       <h2>IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT THE HACKATHON</h2>

<details><summary><h3>Project Categories</h3></summary>

- <strong>A Useful Tool  or Integration for Everyone</strong>
In our day-to-day workflows we often find ourselves lacking a really simple tool or integration that could simplify our open source or dev work significantly.<br/>
We encourage you to think about something that is useful on a daily basis, and can optimize work with common cloud native OSS tools.

- <strong>Solve a Universally felt Challenge</strong>
As a global community of OSS enthusiasts in the cloud native ecosystem has users and community members around the globe leveraging its tools and frameworks.<br/>
We encourage you to think of innovative ways to solve daily OSS & cloud native ecosystem challenges that can benefit everyone - from communication to collaboration, and more.

- <strong>A Significant Product Enhancement</strong>
What’s a hackathon without fun?! Sometimes we just want to play around with gadgets and gizmos, and put something together that can be useful or just for fun.<br/>
If you have a significant product enhancement that brings direct value to OSS users, build ways to make these cloud native products even better.

- <strong>An Exciting Demonstration of Craft</strong>
Many times we have excellent ideas ways to improve the OSS tooling experience, but don’t necessarily have the time to work on them with our regular workloads, and so they remain in the backlog.<br/>
You are more than encouraged to build something with any of the suggested OSS projects that does something unique, and is just super cool and nifty.

<details><summary><h3>Guidelines & Criteria</h3></summary>

Serverless architecture and patterns have changed the velocity and scale at which modern business applications can be delivered, enabling engineering teams to focus on business value, without having to manage compute resources. As serverless gains adoption, the would-be attackers come prowling - and this means serverless security needs to level up. That said, serverless security knowledge is still not a commodity, as most of the current security tools, apps and practices are targeted at more legacy architecture patterns, making it challenging to ramp up security at the pace of engineering.

Excellent resources have been created over the years, including the OWASP Serverless Top 10, however, understanding how to practically apply these takes time and research if you aren't a domain expert.  In this talk, we'll take a deep dive on what a typical serverless app composed of lambda functions and containers looks like, including the various layers it's comprised of: code, infrastructure , runtime and its supply chain. We'll map each of these to the possible risks based on the OWASP Top 10 list, and demo through excellent AWS services and opens source tools how you can defend your application against these threats on each of your application's layers.  You'll come away from this talk able to immediately start better securing your serverless apps.
