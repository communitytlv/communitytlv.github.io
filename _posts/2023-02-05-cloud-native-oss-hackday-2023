       <h2>IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT THE HACKATHON</h2>

<details><summary><h3>Project Categories</h3></summary>

Serverless architecture and patterns have changed the velocity and scale at which modern business applications can be delivered, enabling engineering teams to focus on business value, without having to manage compute resources. As serverless gains adoption, the would-be attackers come prowling - and this means serverless security needs to level up. That said, serverless security knowledge is still not a commodity, as most of the current security tools, apps and practices are targeted at more legacy architecture patterns, making it challenging to ramp up security at the pace of engineering.

Excellent resources have been created over the years, including the OWASP Serverless Top 10, however, understanding how to practically apply these takes time and research if you aren't a domain expert.  In this talk, we'll take a deep dive on what a typical serverless app composed of lambda functions and containers looks like, including the various layers it's comprised of: code, infrastructure , runtime and its supply chain. We'll map each of these to the possible risks based on the OWASP Top 10 list, and demo through excellent AWS services and opens source tools how you can defend your application against these threats on each of your application's layers.  You'll come away from this talk able to immediately start better securing your serverless apps.
