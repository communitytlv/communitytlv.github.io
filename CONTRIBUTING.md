All contributions, including merge requests, feature requests, ideas, design tweaks, etc. are welcome. 
I welcome all input, from sharing your own implementations of code to general thoughts and ideas. Just open a new issue!

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are always welcome! If Jekyll can do it and if the theme's design would work well with it, then I would love to add it. Of course, 
code submission via a merge/pull request is great, but not necessary.

## Bug Reports

If you encounter any issues with these themes on any devices, please submit a bug report with the device type and a detailed description of what 
the issue that you're encountering is.

## Run locally

Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine. Then, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:4000` where you can see the website.

To watch the server logs, run:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
