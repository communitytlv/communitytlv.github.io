			<h2>Our Communities</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Community Summit TLV was born out of the "new normal". While we initially made the decision to opt out of holding our community events this, namely DevOpsDatys Tel Aviv, Statscraft, Cloud Native Day Tel Aviv, and DevSecCon Tel Aviv, we realized we simply couldn't go another whole year without seeing our community friends.  So we decided to create Community Summit TLV 2020, a virtual event that will aggregate content from these excellent communities into an awesome one-day event.</p>
		<p><strong>DOES THE WORLD REALLY NEED ANOTHER VIRTUAL EVENT?!</strong></p>

					<h3>StatsCraft</h3>
				</header>
				<p><a href="https://www.statscraft.org.il/" target="_blank">StatsCraft</a> is the foremost conference in Tel Aviv about making monitoring easier, more accessible and more productive.<br/>Monitoring is crucial for detecting problems, optimizing performance, capacity planning, improving user experience and business impact... Yet in many companies, monitoring is an afterthought leading companies to miss out on the value of the data they collected. We often hear that "monitoring is hard" - and it can be, unless we do something about it.</p>
