	<div><p>DataOps is harder than you might think. Supporting the operations of big data environments poses a challenge greater than the known application-level support due to the complexity of managing data together with the application. Why is data adding so much complexity? Well, Data is big, so all systems are now becoming distributed. Data is mutable, and it's hard to create repeatable, automated pipelines. On top of that, the technology is evolving at high speed and change management is messy. In this talk, we will dive into those challenges, explore best practices, and develop empathy for those who manage big data environments. </p>

		<p>The software engineering field lacks hunch-based decisions.<br />
         It's oriented towards making things right, rather than going YOLO and enjoying life. <br />
        In my talk I'm suggesting an alternate approach, where production is important, but not as much as the feelings of the person changing production.</p>

Which open source SW is gaining popularity? <br />We went and asked this and much more to nearly 1000 engineers across the globe, to check the pulse on DevOps.</p>

	<div><p>When we build systems our design and tradeoffs reflect the different scales of the system: the speed of disks, latency of network; They reflect the constraints and abilities of the underlying technologies. But as technology advances some of these assumptions have become invalid. We are no longer running on physical machines for which RDBMS systems were designed; SSD changed pretty much everything in the storage world, but our software was designed for magnetic disks; NVRAM? O/S design is way off. This talk will show how changes in hardware technologies impact design rational of various systems, highlighting the importance of understanding and rethinking the design rational and explore new designs that arise from the new rational. </p>

		<span style="color: #8d82c4;">// Orit Wasserman</span></h4>
		<p>We live in a data driven world, and the data needs to be stored somewhere on some storage. This makes the storage a critical resource that may break your application and even lose all your data! Ignoring it just won‚Äôt work. You have to choose the right kind of storage for your workload: block, file or object. You need to use it wisely or you will lose performance and scale. You need to consider cost efficiency or pay a large bill in the end of the month You must make sure your data is secure by using best practices, access control and encryption. Don‚Äôt forget about Data protection as losing your data is a huge disaster!</p>

		<p>With Kubernetes becoming the standard container orchestration tool, we got to a point in which apps are deployed and managed in the same ecosystem for different purposes. As a result, the number of Kubernetes distributions started to rise in order to deal with different scenarios. To name a few: OpenShift, RKE, Tanzu‚Ä¶ K3s is one of the newest distributions made by Rancher, which is an open source project that recently joined the list of CNCF Sandbox projects. The main goal of K3s is providing a lightweight k8s distribution using a single binary, while reducing the memory consumed by the orchestration tool.In this lightning talk we will discuss what k3s is, compare it to k8s and see how it can be installed for different purposes: CI, Edge, development and production.</p>

		<span style="color: #8d82c4; text-transform: uppercase;">// Boaz Ziniman</span></h4>
		<p>How do you avoid DDoSing other systems or running out of resources when developing serverless applications? Serverless cloud based applications bring new challenges with their architecture and scaling capabilities. In a perfect world, this should be an advantage only, but we all know by now, that the world ain‚Äôt perfect. Integrating serverless with non-serveless systems is a challenge you should take into account and plan accordingly. This session will focus on why rate limiting is so important in serverless systems and how you should design a better system that acts as a better neighbors.</p>

		<span style="color: #8d82c4;">// Zeev Suraski</span></h4>
		<p>Open Source is an integral part of virtually all modern software development. However, it is often too easy to not realize that some Open Source packages may come with strings attached to them - in the form of their license. In fact, some packages that might seem to be Open Source, may technically not be ones at all.<br />In the talk, some of the most commonly found licenses and their implications on end users will be discussed: - GPL-style licenses, including Affero GPL - BSD-style licenses - Source-available licenses.<br />If you‚Äôve never heard about these licenses, or if you did hear about them but never really bothered to understand how they may affect you - attending this talk may be a good idea.</p>

So first person it is! I‚Äôm a software engineer at heart. Two years ago I started a company with another engineer, my co-founder Ori Keren. I pulled the short straw so actually at the moment I‚Äôm responsible for customer success, marketing and sales. Which is crazy because I had never done any of those things before LinearB. I wish I had more time to write code but I love being customer facing because I‚Äôm learning a lot of new stuff. Before LinearB I was a dev team lead, and VP of Engineering. I‚Äôm obsessed with how dev teams work together. Like what makes great culture? And how can engineering leaders be data-driven without being performance tyrants? And why can cars drive themselves but I have to spend 30 minutes every day manually updating my project tickets? :-) More importantly, my partner Lauren and I just had a beautiful baby girl named Leila. We recently moved to sunny Southern California which is a welcome change for this suburban boy from up-state New York.</small></div>

		<p>Sixty percent of hackers don‚Äôt submit vulnerabilities due to the fear of out-of-date legislation, press coverage, and companies misdirected policies. This fear is based on socially constructed beliefs. This talk dives into the brain‚Äôs response to fear while focusing on increasing public awareness in order to bring legislation that supports ethical hackers, ending black hoodie and ski mask imagery, and encourage organizations to support bilateral trust within their policies.</p>

		<span style="color: #8d82c4; text-transform: uppercase;">// YANIV SIMSOLO</span></h4>
		<p>In this presentation I will briefly present some insights on the soft belly of DevOps. Even when SecDevOps is used, there are additional factors that should be understood for having a DevOps system or a DevOps operation secure. Some of the insights that I gain in the past years and most recently as the security manager of a major media company:
        <ul>
        <li>SecDevOps requires more people ‚Äì security architects and security experts.</li>
        <li>Juniors will not cut it.</li>
        <li>Operational security experts will not do.</li>
        <li>Refer to OWASP IL by me: Should I Trust my Vendor</li>
        <li>Knowledge Gap ‚Äì a very nefarious serial killer of DevOps, destroyer of security operations </li>
        <li>Ludicrous security tools ‚Äì some tools are no good. In some ecosystems the best of breed tools is useless.</li>
        <li>Testbenching the 2 best of breed tools, mano-a-mano.</li>
        <li>Orientation on content and delivery </li></ul>

		<span style="color: #8d82c4; text-transform: uppercase;">// QUINTESSENCE ANX</span></h4>
		<p>One of the hardest parts professionally during this pandemic is how to shift a role that was mostly face-to-face and high travel to being 100% virtual - without losing the connection that in person interaction provides. This has led to a lot of growing pains over the past 8 months (!!!), but as a company cornerstoned in process we adapted our workflow to accommodate our New Abnormal. This is a 5 minute talk where I will run through how we shifted our workflow, not just by top loading already virtual content like blog posts but also focusing on other ways that the advocacy team could assist the business as a whole including shifting how to handle virtual events, booth duty, changes in how to present at virtual events, and more.</p>

		<p>Innovation is how you win customers; reliability is how you keep them. To succeed, you need both. But as organizations adopt Service Level Objectives (SLOs) as part of their Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, they become fixated on reliability and innovation suffers. In this talk, I‚Äôll discuss why you need to spend more time on innovation and how to do it.

		<p>During the past 15 years I was lucky to partake in building and monitoring various production systems. However, while sometimes the monitors and alerts we created were spot-on, and helped us mitigate future failures quickly, other times the dashboards we created were simply useless, and the alerts did nothing but make us miserable. In this talk we will review several common monitoring mistakes my peers and I repeatedly tend to lean towards. We will discuss why these are not the right things to do, and suggest several, hopefully better alternatives.</p>

         <h4 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Take Aways from 400 Virtual Talks since March
		<span style="color: #8d82c4; text-transform: uppercase;">// PHILIPP KRENN</span></h4>
		<p>Virtual talks are the new norm. In theory, they are great ‚Äî speakers and attendees can join from around the world, infrastructure is cheap and scalable, recordings are simple. But what is happening in reality with problems like Zoom fatigue? What is and what isn‚Äôt working? At Elastic, we have done 400 virtual talks and meetups since March. This talk gives an overview of the development over time, specifics in regions, differences in tooling,‚Ä¶ and adds some personal anecdotes.</p>
