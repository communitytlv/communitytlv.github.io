        <h4>KEYNOTE: THE WORLD HAS CHANGED - HAVE OUR DESIGNS?</h4>
        <div>ABSTRACT</div>
        <div><small>When we build systems our design and tradeoffs reflect the different scales of the system: the speed of disks, latency of network; They reflect the constraints and abilities of the underlying technologies. But as technology advances some of these assumptions have become invalid. We are no longer running on physical machines for which RDBMS systems were designed; SSD changed pretty much everything in the storage world, but our software was designed for magnetic disks; NVRAM? O/S design is way off. This talk will show how changes in hardware technologies impact design rational of various systems, highlighting the importance of understanding and rethinking the design rational and explore new designs that arise from the new rational.</small></div>

        <div><small>For the past few years, together with Ran Locar, we're running a side project to find sensitive data exposed by governments and large corporations. Although the code is usually OK from a security POV, in many cases the OPSEC is so bad it makes the effort invested in developing good code - redundant. In this talk we'll cover a few cases unearthed by our project, explore the failures, and discuss ways to prevent such catastrophes from happening on your systems.</small></div>

        <div>IGNITE</div>
        <div><small>There are many opinions on DevOps, open source, and cloud-native tech, but what is actually being practiced? What can we learn from the collective experience of the community? We went and surveyed over 1000 engineers across the globe about their DevOps practices, challenges, and more, with special focus on cloud native and observability. This session will share data and insights from the survey, with key trends (compared to previous years’ DevOps Pulse surveys), points of interest, and challenges that developers experience on a daily basis. This session will help you learn from the collective experience and emerging best practices in the community, to help guide decisions on processes, tooling and architecture choices.</small></div>

        <div>IGNITE</div>
        <div><small>The Challenger launched for the last time on January 28th, 1986. It never reached orbit. The Challenger disaster was not only a failure of the technology, but a failure of the engineering and management culture in NASA. While engineers were aware of problems in the technology stack, there was no conception of the risks they actually posed to the spacecraft. Management had shifted the focus from “prove that it’s safe to launch” to “prove that it’s unsafe to stop the launch”. This session will present the risk analysis (or lack thereof) of the Shuttle program and draw parallels to modern software development. In the end, launching a shuttle is an extremely complex deployment to the cloud… and above it.</small></div>

To name a few: OpenShift, RKE, Tanzu… K3s is one of the newest distributions made by Rancher, which is an open source project that recently joined the list of CNCF Sandbox projects. The main goal of K3s is providing a lightweight k8s distribution using a single binary, while reducing the memory consumed by the orchestration tool.In this lightning talk we will discuss what k3s is, compare it to k8s and see how it can be installed for different purposes: CI, Edge, development and production.</small></div>

        High availability is the holy grail of an architect, ensuring the system’s uptime is achieved for a higher than normal period. This can be achieved with an Active-Active architecture and Active-Passive architecture, which, in turn, can be deployed using different models, eg multi-site clustering and cross datacenter replication. The performance is monitored to ensure the system is meeting the agreed upon SLAs and SLOs.<br />Let’s understand all those terms, the relationships between them and how to implement those.</small></div>

        <div><small>
       Flamegraph is a visualization of hierarchical data used to show sampling profiling results. We found them to be extremely useful observability tools. At eBay, we use Flamegraphs to triage performance problems and visualize service behaviour in production. In this talk we’ll go over Flamegraphs, their strengths and limitations. We’ll also explore ideas to extend the technology especially in performance regression analysis where the current solution struggles and a view of more than a single Flamegraph is required to compare different runs.</small></div>

        <div>IGNITE</div>
        <div><small>In this presentation I will briefly present some insights on the soft belly of DevOps. Even when SecDevOps is used, there are additional factors that should be understood for having a DevOps system or a DevOps operation secure. Some of the insights that I gain in the past years and most recently as the security manager of a major media company:
        <ul>
        <li>SecDevOps requires more people – security architects and security experts.</li>
        <li>Juniors will not cut it.</li>
        <li>Operational security experts will not do.</li>
        <li>Refer to OWASP IL by me: Should I Trust my Vendor</li>
        <li>Knowledge Gap – a very nefarious serial killer of DevOps, destroyer of security operations </li>
        <li>Ludicrous security tools – some tools are no good. In some ecosystems the best of breed tools is useless.</li>
        <li>Testbenching the 2 best of breed tools, mano-a-mano.</li>
        <li>Orientation on content and delivery </li></ul></small></div>
