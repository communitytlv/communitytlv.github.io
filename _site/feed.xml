        &lt;div&gt;&lt;small&gt;Einat Orr is the CEO and Co-founder of Treeverse, the company behind lakeFS, an open source platform that delivers resilience and manageability to object-storage based data lakes. She received her PhD. in Mathematics from Tel Aviv University, in the field of optimization in graph theory. Einat previously led several engineering organizations, most recently as CTO at SimilarWeb.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;  
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;DataOps is harder than you might think. Supporting the operations of big data environments poses a challenge greater than the known application-level support due to the complexity of managing data together with the application. Why is data adding so much complexity? Well, Data is big, so all systems are now becoming distributed. Data is mutable, and it's hard to create repeatable, automated pipelines. On top of that, the technology is evolving at high speed and change management is messy. In this talk, we will dive into those challenges, explore best practices, and develop empathy for those who manage big data environments. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The software engineering field lacks hunch-based decisions.&lt;br /&gt;

        In my talk I'm suggesting an alternate approach, where production is important, but not as much as the feelings of the person changing production.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we build systems our design and tradeoffs reflect the different scales of the system: the speed of disks, latency of network; They reflect the constraints and abilities of the underlying technologies. But as technology advances some of these assumptions have become invalid. We are no longer running on physical machines for which RDBMS systems were designed; SSD changed pretty much everything in the storage world, but our software was designed for magnetic disks; NVRAM? O/S design is way off. This talk will show how changes in hardware technologies impact design rational of various systems, highlighting the importance of understanding and rethinking the design rational and explore new designs that arise from the new rational. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;span style=&quot;color: #8d82c4;&quot;&gt;// Orit Wasserman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We live in a data driven world, and the data needs to be stored somewhere on some storage. This makes the storage a critical resource that may break your application and even lose all your data! Ignoring it just won‚Äôt work. You have to choose the right kind of storage for your workload: block, file or object. You need to use it wisely or you will lose performance and scale. You need to consider cost efficiency or pay a large bill in the end of the month You must make sure your data is secure by using best practices, access control and encryption. Don‚Äôt forget about Data protection as losing your data is a huge disaster!&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;With standard Kubernetes networking, connectivity is limited to a single cluster only, requiring proxies to connect workloads across clusters for migration, disaster-recovery, or geographic locality. Submariner is an open source project that enables high-performance cross-cluster connectivity and Service Discovery between different Kubernetes clusters, either on-premises or in the cloud. With Submariner, your applications and services can span multiple cloud providers, datacenters, and regions.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;With Kubernetes becoming the standard container orchestration tool, we got to a point in which apps are deployed and managed in the same ecosystem for different purposes. As a result, the number of Kubernetes distributions started to rise in order to deal with different scenarios. To name a few: OpenShift, RKE, Tanzu‚Ä¶ K3s is one of the newest distributions made by Rancher, which is an open source project that recently joined the list of CNCF Sandbox projects. The main goal of K3s is providing a lightweight k8s distribution using a single binary, while reducing the memory consumed by the orchestration tool.In this lightning talk we will discuss what k3s is, compare it to k8s and see how it can be installed for different purposes: CI, Edge, development and production.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;How do you avoid DDoSing other systems or running out of resources when developing serverless applications? Serverless cloud based applications bring new challenges with their architecture and scaling capabilities. In a perfect world, this should be an advantage only, but we all know by now, that the world ain‚Äôt perfect. Integrating serverless with non-serveless systems is a challenge you should take into account and plan accordingly. This session will focus on why rate limiting is so important in serverless systems and how you should design a better system that acts as a better neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase;&quot;&gt;Crash Course: Open Source Licenses
		&lt;span style=&quot;color: #8d82c4;&quot;&gt;// Zeev Suraski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Open Source is an integral part of virtually all modern software development. However, it is often too easy to not realize that some Open Source packages may come with strings attached to them - in the form of their license. In fact, some packages that might seem to be Open Source, may technically not be ones at all.&lt;br /&gt;In the talk, some of the most commonly found licenses and their implications on end users will be discussed: - GPL-style licenses, including Affero GPL - BSD-style licenses - Source-available licenses.&lt;br /&gt;If you‚Äôve never heard about these licenses, or if you did hear about them but never really bothered to understand how they may affect you - attending this talk may be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div style=&quot;text-transform: uppercase;&quot;&gt;Dan's Bio&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dan here. A few things about me‚Ä¶ First of all, the only thing I find more awkward than writing a bio about myself is asking someone else to write one about me. So first person it is! I‚Äôm a software engineer at heart. Two years ago I started a company with another engineer, my co-founder Ori Keren. I pulled the short straw so actually at the moment I‚Äôm responsible for customer success, marketing and sales. Which is crazy because I had never done any of those things before LinearB. I wish I had more time to write code but I love being customer facing because I‚Äôm learning a lot of new stuff. Before LinearB I was a dev team lead, and VP of Engineering. I‚Äôm obsessed with how dev teams work together. Like what makes great culture? And how can engineering leaders be data-driven without being performance tyrants? And why can cars drive themselves but I have to spend 30 minutes every day manually updating my project tickets? :-) More importantly, my partner Lauren and I just had a beautiful baby girl named Leila. We recently moved to sunny Southern California which is a welcome change for this suburban boy from up-state New York.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;span style=&quot;color: #8d82c4; text-transform: uppercase;&quot;&gt;// Dan Lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Burnout is dangerous. Even more so when we can‚Äôt see the physical indicators due to being a distributed team. In this lighting talk I discuss the 3 data-driven burnout indicators I use to make sure my team rested and happy.  As a manager it‚Äôs your responsibility to identify employee burnout and make sure your dev team is rested and healthy. But identifying signs of burnout as a distributed team can be challenging. In this lightning talk I discuss the 3 data-driven burnout indicators I use to make sure my team rested and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You only have ONE repository, build artifact, deployment step, process, and version that you can run locally but still scale horizontally. Sounds too good to be true and you think it must be a theoretical example? Far from it‚Ä¶You might even be running such a monolith yourself. Though there are of course some tradeoffs that we are covering as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Voice is one of the first capabilities we acquire as newborns, and one of the last we lose before we leave this world. Voice communication is the fastest, most natural and efficient way to convey an idea, so why is it so hard for machines to understand the human language? &lt;br /&gt;During this five minute talk, I'll share several tips that will help drive engagement when designing virtual assistant conversations, without ever compromising on experience..&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;&lt;small&gt; Noam Rotem is a CTO of a young VC backed start-up. in the past 25 years he built several large systems that are still being used by millions of people around the world. In his spare time, he hosts the popular podcast 'Cyber Cyber' covering various aspects of the cyber security scene, and is a renowned security researcher featured in some of the world's biggest media outlets.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;  

		&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, together with Ran Locar, we're running a side project to find sensitive data exposed by governments and large corporations. Although the code is usually OK from a security POV, in many cases the OPSEC is so bad it makes the effort invested in developing good code - redundant. In this talk we'll cover a few cases unearthed by our project, explore the failures, and discuss ways to prevent such catastrophes from happening on your systems.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Whilst testing a directory traversal vulnerability within one of our services, I found that I got different behaviour when testing through a load balancer and direct to the service. This talk is about the research the that followed. Key Findings Discussed: AWS Application Load Balancers share code with NGINX, NGINX parses http urls in a special way which results in a protective behaviour for directory traversal attacks, How I bypassed this protection behaviour, and Quick lessons from the research&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will briefly present some insights on the soft belly of DevOps. Even when SecDevOps is used, there are additional factors that should be understood for having a DevOps system or a DevOps operation secure. Some of the insights that I gain in the past years and most recently as the security manager of a major media company:
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;SecDevOps requires more people ‚Äì security architects and security experts.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Juniors will not cut it.&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts professionally during this pandemic is how to shift a role that was mostly face-to-face and high travel to being 100% virtual - without losing the connection that in person interaction provides. This has led to a lot of growing pains over the past 8 months (!!!), but as a company cornerstoned in process we adapted our workflow to accommodate our New Abnormal. This is a 5 minute talk where I will run through how we shifted our workflow, not just by top loading already virtual content like blog posts but also focusing on other ways that the advocacy team could assist the business as a whole including shifting how to handle virtual events, booth duty, changes in how to present at virtual events, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Innovation is how you win customers; reliability is how you keep them. To succeed, you need both. But as organizations adopt Service Level Objectives (SLOs) as part of their Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, they become fixated on reliability and innovation suffers. In this talk, I‚Äôll discuss why you need to spend more time on innovation and how to do it. I‚Äôll also share how you can escape your everyday toil and stressful firefighting to rediscover the fun in engineering‚Äîand help your company succeed at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;High availability is the holy grail of an architect, ensuring the system‚Äôs uptime is achieved for a higher than normal period. This can be achieved with an Active-Active architecture and Active-Passive architecture, which, in turn, can be deployed using different models, eg multi-site clustering and cross datacenter replication. The performance is monitored to ensure the system is meeting the agreed upon SLAs and SLOs.&lt;br /&gt;Let‚Äôs understand all those terms, the relationships between them and how to implement those.&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôm sure, using the right tools and thinking of monitoring as a product, it‚Äôs possible to build intuitive and user-friendly monitoring, which will dramatically reduce the amount of debugging and troubleshooting in your life.

We‚Äôll also explore ideas to extend the technology especially in performance regression analysis where the current solution struggles and a view of more than a single Flamegraph is required to compare different runs.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;span style=&quot;color: #8d82c4; text-transform: uppercase;&quot;&gt;// NATI COHEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;During the past 15 years I was lucky to partake in building and monitoring various production systems. However, while sometimes the monitors and alerts we created were spot-on, and helped us mitigate future failures quickly, other times the dashboards we created were simply useless, and the alerts did nothing but make us miserable. In this talk we will review several common monitoring mistakes my peers and I repeatedly tend to lean towards. We will discuss why these are not the right things to do, and suggest several, hopefully better alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

She received her PhD. in Mathematics from Tel Aviv University, in the field of optimization in graph theory. Einat previously led several engineering organizations, most recently as CTO at SimilarWeb. DataOps is harder than you might think. Supporting the operations of big data environments poses a challenge greater than the known application-level support due to the complexity of managing data together with the application. Why is data adding so much complexity? Well, Data is big, so all systems are now becoming distributed. Data is mutable, and it's hard to create repeatable, automated pipelines. On top of that, the technology is evolving at high speed and change management is messy. In this talk, we will dive into those challenges, explore best practices, and develop empathy for those who manage big data environments. 10:20 AM - 10:30 AM IST BREAK COUCHBASE: Any Scale, Any Load, Always On // Lior King, Senior Solution Engineer In this session, we‚Äôll learn why Couchbase is an ideal data platform for modern applications, how it delivers scalability, performance, and agility, and why it is a great source of truth. 10:30 AM - 11:10 AM IST DevOpsDays Ignites JULIA SHUB LAWGEEX X Julia's Bio Julia Shub, DevOps Lead @ Lawgeex Redhead extraordinaire, queen of sunscreen and wearer of hats.

MICHAEL ZION APPSFLYER X Michael's Bio I‚Äôm currently making stuff ‚òï ‚Äì&amp;gt; üßë‚Äçüíª ‚Äì&amp;gt; ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Linkedin Profile Waste-Oriented, Hunch-Based Web Architecture // Michael Zion The software engineering field lacks hunch-based decisions. It's oriented towards making things right, rather than going YOLO and enjoying life. In my talk I'm suggesting an alternate approach, where production is important, but not as much as the feelings of the person changing production. ROBERT BARRON IBM X Robert's Bio Robert is a Senior Managing Consultant and member of the IBM Garage Solution Engineering group. Within the worldwide Garage Solution Engineering group, he is part of the Cloud Service Management and Operations (CSMO) team, working in all fields of CSMO and specializing in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Chat Operations (ChatOps).Robert joined IBM in 2007 and has held various positions in IBM, all in the field of Service Management.

Firm believer in continuous improvement and organisational transparency. Resilience Engineering - a Primer // Anton Weiss Lately we've heard some buzz around the term &quot;resilience engineering&quot; in relation to information systems. Much of it initiated by none other but John Allspaw - the man who inspired the birth of DevOps. My talk will lay out how the ideas of resilience engineering relate to our daily work. DOTAN HOROVITS LOGZ.IO X Dotan's Bio I‚Äôve been a dev, I‚Äôve been an architect, I‚Äôve been a product, and I‚Äôve lived to tell the tale. I love working with others to leverage experience and best practices to avoid common mistakes, and I‚Äôm captivated by novel ideas and technologies that try to make sense of the ever-increasing complexity of our world. Checking the pulse on DevOps and Observability // Dotan Horovits What are the biggest obstacles to Observability? Is Observability just the DevOps' responsibility? How many companies actually use tracing? Which open source SW is gaining popularity? We went and asked this and much more to nearly 1000 engineers across the globe, to check the pulse on DevOps. HEIDI WATERHOUSELAUNCH DARKLY X Heidi's Bio Heidi is a developer advocate with LaunchDarkly. She delights in working at the intersection of usability, risk reduction, and cutting-edge technology. One of her favorite hobbies is talking to developers about things they already knew but had never thought of that way before. She sews all her conference dresses so that she‚Äôs sure there is a pocket for the mic. The Devil's DevOps // Heidi Waterhouse An Ignite that plays off Ambrose Bierce's The Devil's Dictionary to present satirical and painfully true definitions of words you hear at conferences all the time. ERIK ZAADI SALTO X Monitoring People - An Engineering approach to understanding human KPIs Erik's Bio DadOps supreme, been doing web since FrontPage98, Operations since .bat was extreme and all around geek, previously a Team Leader, now a passionate IC. Addicted to automating ALL THE THINGZ, from CI to opening doors. DadPun advocate, PagerDaddy. Monitoring People - An Engineering approach to understanding human KPIs // Erik Zaadi Feel like understanding systems is easier and more logical than people? Let's challenge that and see how engineering practices such as monitoring and CI can be correlated to understanding and improving humans, you know, those illogical chaotic beings, which are sooooo much different than production. 11:10 AM - 11:30 AM IST BREAK SPONSOR TALKS APPSFLYER: Death by balloons // Gil Zellner &amp;amp; Elad Leev Short story about how doing something innocent and safe at scale can go horribly wrong. AWS: This talk will save you more than 50% of your AWS bill // Boaz Ziniman Cloud computing changed the way we consume and pay for computing resources. Paying for what you use, and only for that, is key to get the best ROI out of your cloud investment. This session will focus on one solution that can lower your AWS bill on idle computing. NEXT INSURANCE: DevOps the Next Insurance Way // Moshe Ben Shoham Next Insurance offers a simple, affordable &amp;amp; tailored business insurance, designed for small businesses.

X Nur's Bio Chief Awesomeness Officer at EventHandler, Frontend Communities Manager, DevRel consultant, international tech conferences organizer and producer (such as AngualrUP, React Next, Node.TLV, React Week NY and more), proud cat-mom, and knows how to use the oxford comma. CLOUD NATIVE &amp;amp; OSS MINI-TRACK 11:30 AM - 12:10 PM IST Keynote | THE WORLD HAS CHANGED - HAVE OUR DESIGNS? // Avishai Ish-Shalom AVISHAI ISH-SHALOM SCYLLADB X Avishai's BIO ‚ÄúIn a world where anything has an API, everything is a software problem‚Äù this insight has guided Avishai Ish-Shalom throughout his diverse career working on improving the complex socio-technical systems that create and operate modern software and promoting the use of Mathematics in system design and operations. Spending 15 years in various software fields and capacities, Avishai has served as Engineer in Residence in Aleph VC, engineering manager at Wix.com, co-founded Fewbytes and consulted many other companies on software operations, reliability, design and culture. Currently Avishai is a Developer Advocate for ScyllaDB (The boring database ;-) When we build systems our design and tradeoffs reflect the different scales of the system: the speed of disks, latency of network; They reflect the constraints and abilities of the underlying technologies. But as technology advances some of these assumptions have become invalid. We are no longer running on physical machines for which RDBMS systems were designed; SSD changed pretty much everything in the storage world, but our software was designed for magnetic disks; NVRAM? O/S design is way off. This talk will show how changes in hardware technologies impact design rational of various systems, highlighting the importance of understanding and rethinking the design rational and explore new designs that arise from the new rational. 12:10 PM - 12:20 PM IST BREAK Aerospike: From GBs to PBs at Sub-milli ‚Äì The Fast Track to Real-time Applications ‚Äì Live ‚ÄúMagic Show&quot; // Oshrat Ben Avi Zabludovitz and Zohar Elkayam 12:20 PM - 13:00 IST Cloud Native &amp;amp; OSS Ignites ORIT WASSERMAN RED HAT X Orit's Bio Orit is an experienced software engineer who is passionate about open source and infrastructure with extensive experience with distributed systems and storage. She is OpenShift Container Storage Architect at Red Hat focusing on storage for Containers, hybrid cloud, multi cloud and edge.

In her past role at Red Hat she Co-maintained and developed live migration for KVM/QEMU. Previously at IBM Research Labs, she developed nested virtualization for KVM. Rant: Everybody talks about data but nobody talks about storage // Orit Wasserman We live in a data driven world, and the data needs to be stored somewhere on some storage. This makes the storage a critical resource that may break your application and even lose all your data! Ignoring it just won‚Äôt work. You have to choose the right kind of storage for your workload: block, file or object. You need to use it wisely or you will lose performance and scale. You need to consider cost efficiency or pay a large bill in the end of the month You must make sure your data is secure by using best practices, access control and encryption. Don‚Äôt forget about Data protection as losing your data is a huge disaster! NIR YECHIEL RED HAT X Nir's Bio Nir Yechiel is currently an Engineering Manager at Red Hat, working on hybrid cloud networking. Nir is a long time contributor and advocate of open source networking projects, ranging from Linux, to Open vSwitch, OpenStack, OpenDaylight and Kubernetes. Nir was previously a Product Manager on the Connectivity team at Facebook, and prior to that on the Cloud Platforms Business Unit at Red Hat. Submariner: multi-cluster networking for Kubernetes // NIR YECHIEL With standard Kubernetes networking, connectivity is limited to a single cluster only, requiring proxies to connect workloads across clusters for migration, disaster-recovery, or geographic locality. Submariner is an open source project that enables high-performance cross-cluster connectivity and Service Discovery between different Kubernetes clusters, either on-premises or in the cloud. With Submariner, your applications and services can span multiple cloud providers, datacenters, and regions. RONEN LEVINSON SISENSE X Ronen's Bio Ronen Levinson is a DevOps Engineer at Sisense. Ronen is passionate about new technologies, open source projects and cloud-native tools. He is an organizer of GitHub User Group, a meetup group which discuss GitHub new features and Git practices. k3s: From Development to Production at the speed of light // RONEN LEVINSON With Kubernetes becoming the standard container orchestration tool, we got to a point in which apps are deployed and managed in the same ecosystem for different purposes. As a result, the number of Kubernetes distributions started to rise in order to deal with different scenarios. To name a few: OpenShift, RKE, Tanzu‚Ä¶ K3s is one of the newest distributions made by Rancher, which is an open source project that recently joined the list of CNCF Sandbox projects. The main goal of K3s is providing a lightweight k8s distribution using a single binary, while reducing the memory consumed by the orchestration tool.In this lightning talk we will discuss what k3s is, compare it to k8s and see how it can be installed for different purposes: CI, Edge, development and production. BOAZ ZINIMAN AWS X Boaz's Bio Boaz Ziniman is a Principal Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Services. He raises customer awareness of AWS services and, in particular, helps customers understand the benefits that the AWS Cloud can deliver. Boaz has many years of experience with web development and operations, architecture, IT management, and cloud.Prior to joining AWS, Boaz worked with a variety of key Israeli startups‚Äîmanaging development and operations teams as well as leading cloud adoption and partnerships with major cloud vendors. Being good neighbors - Rate limiting in a serverless world // Boaz Ziniman How do you avoid DDoSing other systems or running out of resources when developing serverless applications? Serverless cloud based applications bring new challenges with their architecture and scaling capabilities. In a perfect world, this should be an advantage only, but we all know by now, that the world ain‚Äôt perfect. Integrating serverless with non-serveless systems is a challenge you should take into account and plan accordingly. This session will focus on why rate limiting is so important in serverless systems and how you should design a better system that acts as a better neighbors. SPOTLIGHT IGNITE ZEEV SURASKI STRATTIC X Zeev's Bio Zeev Suraski is one of the creators of the PHP programming language, which powers much of the Internet to this date. Zeev was co-founder &amp;amp; CTO of Zend Technologies, that was acquired by Rogue Wave Software. Today, he‚Äôs the CTO for Strattic - a next-gen static &amp;amp; serverless hosting service for WordPress web sites. Zeev is a photography enthusiast, spicy food addict and a gadget geek. Crash Course: Open Source Licenses // Zeev Suraski Open Source is an integral part of virtually all modern software development. However, it is often too easy to not realize that some Open Source packages may come with strings attached to them - in the form of their license. In fact, some packages that might seem to be Open Source, may technically not be ones at all.In the talk, some of the most commonly found licenses and their implications on end users will be discussed: - GPL-style licenses, including Affero GPL - BSD-style licenses - Source-available licenses.If you‚Äôve never heard about these licenses, or if you did hear about them but never really bothered to understand how they may affect you - attending this talk may be a good idea. DAN LINES LINEARB X Dan's Bio Dan here. A few things about me‚Ä¶ First of all, the only thing I find more awkward than writing a bio about myself is asking someone else to write one about me. So first person it is! I‚Äôm a software engineer at heart. Two years ago I started a company with another engineer, my co-founder Ori Keren. I pulled the short straw so actually at the moment I‚Äôm responsible for customer success, marketing and sales. Which is crazy because I had never done any of those things before LinearB. I wish I had more time to write code but I love being customer facing because I‚Äôm learning a lot of new stuff. Before LinearB I was a dev team lead, and VP of Engineering. I‚Äôm obsessed with how dev teams work together. Like what makes great culture? And how can engineering leaders be data-driven without being performance tyrants? And why can cars drive themselves but I have to spend 30 minutes every day manually updating my project tickets? :-) More importantly, my partner Lauren and I just had a beautiful baby girl named Leila. We recently moved to sunny Southern California which is a welcome change for this suburban boy from up-state New York. 3 DATA DRIVEN BURNOUT INDICATORS // Dan Lines Burnout is dangerous. Even more so when we can‚Äôt see the physical indicators due to being a distributed team. In this lighting talk I discuss the 3 data-driven burnout indicators I use to make sure my team rested and happy. As a manager it‚Äôs your responsibility to identify employee burnout and make sure your dev team is rested and healthy. But identifying signs of burnout as a distributed team can be challenging. In this lightning talk I discuss the 3 data-driven burnout indicators I use to make sure my team rested and happy. 13:00 - 14:00 IST BREAK SPONSOR TALKS ELASTIC: What Is Great About Modern Monolithic Applications? // Philipp Krenn, Developer Advocate You only have ONE repository, build artifact, deployment step, process, and version that you can run locally but still scale horizontally. Sounds too good to be true and you think it must be a theoretical example? Far from it‚Ä¶You might even be running such a monolith yourself. Though there are of course some tradeoffs that we are covering as well. VONAGE: Conversing with machines: tips for creating meaningful voice interactions // Noam Mor, Conversation Design Lead Voice is one of the first capabilities we acquire as newborns, and one of the last we lose before we leave this world. Voice communication is the fastest, most natural and efficient way to convey an idea, so why is it so hard for machines to understand the human language? During this five minute talk, I'll share several tips that will help drive engagement when designing virtual assistant conversations, without ever compromising on experience.. TERASKY: How to choose your enterprise-grade Kubernetes? // Lev Andelman, CTO Kubernetes comes in many sizes and flavors - choosing a future safe solution for your organization might be challenging. In this short talk I'd like to share our experience with Enterprise Kubernetes market leaders.

In his spare time, he hosts the popular podcast 'Cyber Cyber' covering various aspects of the cyber security scene, and is a renowned security researcher featured in some of the world's biggest media outlets. For the past few years, together with Ran Locar, we're running a side project to find sensitive data exposed by governments and large corporations. Although the code is usually OK from a security POV, in many cases the OPSEC is so bad it makes the effort invested in developing good code - redundant. In this talk we'll cover a few cases unearthed by our project, explore the failures, and discuss ways to prevent such catastrophes from happening on your systems. 14:40 - 14:50 IST BREAK SNYK: Trick or Treat, Hello Dependency Defeat, Liran Tal Hello there dear developer building your app on open source dependencies.

HACKER RIGHTS // CHLO√â MESSDAGHI Sixty percent of hackers don‚Äôt submit vulnerabilities due to the fear of out-of-date legislation, press coverage, and companies misdirected policies. This fear is based on socially constructed beliefs. This talk dives into the brain‚Äôs response to fear while focusing on increasing public awareness in order to bring legislation that supports ethical hackers, ending black hoodie and ski mask imagery, and encourage organizations to support bilateral trust within their policies. YANIV SIMSOLO RTL X Yaniv's Bio A Security Consultant since 2004. Worked for Comsec, 2BSecure, Palantir Security and as a Freelancer. Worked my way to be the CTO of Palantir Security, in 2014.

WHEN DEVOPS FAILS, MISERABLY // YANIV SIMSOLO In this presentation I will briefly present some insights on the soft belly of DevOps. Even when SecDevOps is used, there are additional factors that should be understood for having a DevOps system or a DevOps operation secure. Some of the insights that I gain in the past years and most recently as the security manager of a major media company: SecDevOps requires more people ‚Äì security architects and security experts. Juniors will not cut it. Operational security experts will not do. Refer to OWASP IL by me: Should I Trust my Vendor Knowledge Gap ‚Äì a very nefarious serial killer of DevOps, destroyer of security operations Ludicrous security tools ‚Äì some tools are no good. In some ecosystems the best of breed tools is useless. Testbenching the 2 best of breed tools, mano-a-mano.

QUINTESSENCE ANX DEVELOPER ADVOCATE X Quinn's Bio Quintessence meandered into developer relations after a long tenure in IT and operations roles. After running AWS bills up and then bringing them back down again, she brought her ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù to PagerDuty, where she is a Developer Advocate. Outside of work, she co-founded Inclusive Tech Buffalo and mentors underrepresented groups to help them launch sustainable careers in technology. Virtually Unforeseeable: Pandemic DevRel // QUINTESSENCE ANX One of the hardest parts professionally during this pandemic is how to shift a role that was mostly face-to-face and high travel to being 100% virtual - without losing the connection that in person interaction provides. This has led to a lot of growing pains over the past 8 months (!!!), but as a company cornerstoned in process we adapted our workflow to accommodate our New Abnormal. This is a 5 minute talk where I will run through how we shifted our workflow, not just by top loading already virtual content like blog posts but also focusing on other ways that the advocacy team could assist the business as a whole including shifting how to handle virtual events, booth duty, changes in how to present at virtual events, and more. 15:30 - 16:00 IST BREAK SPONSOR TALKS StatsCraft MINI-TRACK 16:00 - 16:40 IST Keynote | DO YOU REALLY MEASURE WHAT YOUR USERS EXPERIENCE? (HEBREW) // CARMIT DANON CARMIT DANON TERASKY CLOUD &amp;amp; DEVOPS X CARMIT'S BIO Carmit Danon- DevOps engineer &amp;amp; monitoring lead @Terasky Cloud &amp;amp; DevOps. Carmit is a professional DevOps engineer, specializing in monitoring &amp;amp; automation platforms. Carmit has a significant experience and owns deep knowledge in application and infrastructure performance. Previously Carmit worked as a monitoring team leader in a financial enterprise and was responsible for sensitive system‚Äôs availability and reliability. The system is slowing down, the customers are becoming frustrated, but our monitoring shows all green. Everyone handles performance issues, but how do we measure it properly? Are you really measuring what your users experience? Is it possible to measure everything? In my presentation, I will walk you through some of the blind spots we all have in our monitoring systems, and share from my own experience of dealing with performance issues. 16:40 - 17:20 IST StatsCraft Ignites JASON YEE GREMLIN X Jason's Bio Jason Yee is Director of Advocacy at Gremlin where he helps people build more resilient systems by learning from how they fail. He also leads the internal Chaos Engineering practices to make Gremlin more reliable. Previously, he worked at Datadog, O‚ÄôReilly Media, and MongoDB. His pandemic-coping activities include drinking whiskey, cooking everything in a waffle iron, and making chocolate. SLOs: You're missing the point // Jason Yee Innovation is how you win customers; reliability is how you keep them. To succeed, you need both. But as organizations adopt Service Level Objectives (SLOs) as part of their Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, they become fixated on reliability and innovation suffers. In this talk, I‚Äôll discuss why you need to spend more time on innovation and how to do it. I‚Äôll also share how you can escape your everyday toil and stressful firefighting to rediscover the fun in engineering‚Äîand help your company succeed at the same time! NATALIE PISTUNOVICH AEROSPIKE X Natalie's Bio Natalie is a learner, a Google Developer Expert for Go, a public speaker and a sailor.When she‚Äôs not working on robust systems with Aerospike, she is organizing the GopherCon Europe and Cloud Nein conferences, and the Berlin chapters of the Go and Women Techmakers user groups.Prior to that, she was an Engineering Manager, Software and Hardware Engineer, and a Co-Founder of a mobile start-up.In her free time, she is wondering if there is life on Mars. Highway to High Availability // NATALIE PISTUNOVICH High availability is the holy grail of an architect, ensuring the system‚Äôs uptime is achieved for a higher than normal period. This can be achieved with an Active-Active architecture and Active-Passive architecture, which, in turn, can be deployed using different models, eg multi-site clustering and cross datacenter replication. The performance is monitored to ensure the system is meeting the agreed upon SLAs and SLOs.Let‚Äôs understand all those terms, the relationships between them and how to implement those. ANNA TSIBULSKAYA MICROSOFT X Anna's Bio My name is Anna, I‚Äôm working in the IT field for almost a decade in various Software Development roles. I‚Äôve started from QA, worked as a FED, Fullstack Dev, SRE and most recently as an Infrastructure Engineer. And every role I‚Äôve had so far included working on production incidents. I‚Äôve worked for companies aimed at local, nationwide and global markets. Fintech, and web applications. B2B and B2C. What I‚Äôve seen is the same problems while working with production incidents everywhere. That‚Äôs the reason why I decided to share my experience and my passion for troubleshooting and debugging ‚Äî I believe it can help more engineers, teams, and companies too. Optimizing monitoring for first impressions // ANNA TSIBULSKAYA On average, any Instagram story gets 2 sec of attention from a person viewing it. Yes, that‚Äôs the speed with which we‚Äôre already consuming information. But, how much information can you get from a 2sec look at your monitoring? And if you just joined a company and it‚Äôs your first production incident today? I‚Äôm sure, using the right tools and thinking of monitoring as a product, it‚Äôs possible to build intuitive and user-friendly monitoring, which will dramatically reduce the amount of debugging and troubleshooting in your life. My talk is about how to do it, why it‚Äôs important to pay attention to it and how to measure results. AMIR LANGER EBAY X Amir's Bio Amir Langer has developed software for more than two decades now with a passion for high performance and high quality of code. He spent most of his career in the UK including 7 years at LMAX Ltd, the breeding ground for what became ‚Äúmechanical sympathy‚Äù and ‚Äúcontinuous delivery‚Äù. He is now a software architect at eBay. The dark side of Flamegraphs. What we can and cannot see // AMIR LANGER Flamegraph is a visualization of hierarchical data used to show sampling profiling results. We found them to be extremely useful observability tools. At eBay, we use Flamegraphs to triage performance problems and visualize service behaviour in production. In this talk we‚Äôll go over Flamegraphs, their strengths and limitations. We‚Äôll also explore ideas to extend the technology especially in performance regression analysis where the current solution struggles and a view of more than a single Flamegraph is required to compare different runs. SPOTLIGHT IGNITE NATI COHEN X Nati's Bio Nati Cohen is a Production Engineer at Here Technologies and a Teaching Assistant at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya. Previous experience includes: operations consulting, software development, *nix administration and security research in the Intelligence Corps as well as in multiple startup companies.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; 5 Monitoring Anti-Patterns (and how to avoid them) // NATI COHEN During the past 15 years I was lucky to partake in building and monitoring various production systems. However, while sometimes the monitors and alerts we created were spot-on, and helped us mitigate future failures quickly, other times the dashboards we created were simply useless, and the alerts did nothing but make us miserable. In this talk we will review several common monitoring mistakes my peers and I repeatedly tend to lean towards. We will discuss why these are not the right things to do, and suggest several, hopefully better alternatives. PHILIPP KRENN ELASTIC X Philipp's Bio Philipp lives to demo interesting technology. Having worked as a web, infrastructure, and database engineer for more than ten years, Philipp is now working as a developer advocate at Elastic ‚Äî the company behind the open source Elastic Stack consisting of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash. Based in Vienna, Austria, he is constantly traveling Europe and beyond to speak and discuss about open source software, search, databases, infrastructure, and security. Take Aways from 400 Virtual Talks since March // PHILIPP KRENN Virtual talks are the new norm. In theory, they are great ‚Äî speakers and attendees can join from around the world, infrastructure is cheap and scalable, recordings are simple. But what is happening in reality with problems like Zoom fatigue? What is and what isn‚Äôt working? At Elastic, we have done 400 virtual talks and meetups since March. This talk gives an overview of the development over time, specifics in regions, differences in tooling,‚Ä¶ and adds some personal anecdotes. 17:20 - 17:30 IST LAST BIO BREAK...AND YOU'LL NEED ONE BEFORE THE CLOSING SESSION - SO BE QUICK!
