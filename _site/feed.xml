&lt;p&gt;Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community venue, including Discord, channels, talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, and other online media. Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the conference moderators or event organizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the staff (event organizer or moderator) immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff are identified with a separate role in the online forum (event organizer or moderator). Staff will be happy to help participants contact experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of their participation in our community. We value your participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect participants to follow these rules in all community-related media, including Discord, YouTube, Twitter, or any other online presence.&lt;/p&gt;
