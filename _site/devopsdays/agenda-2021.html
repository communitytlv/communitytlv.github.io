                <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                <p>The bottom up approach that changed the way we think about the development processes, has the
                    potential to encompass and ultimately transform many more aspects of engineering - from development
                    to operations and many of its subsets, such as observability, delivery and security. This
                    transformation will dictate the future of shipping products fast and reliably.</p>

                <p>Open source software alongside self-service cloud infrastructure, have enabled engineers to openly
                    collaborate around software; this was the key to making the DevOps culture and the bottom up
                    transformation possible. </p>
                <p>Shay Banon, Founder and CEO of Elastic, will share from his personal experience and vision what he
                    thinks the future of engineering will look like when we bring these disparate disciplines together.
                </p>
                <h4>Bio:</h4>

                <p>As a founder of Elasticsearch and the CEO of <a href="https://elastic.co" target="_blank">Elastic</a>, Shay has been fascinated with search ever since trying to build a
                    recipe app for his wife in 2004, a journey that led to him writing the first few lines of code of
                    Elasticsearch in 2009 and later founding Elastic in 2012. He believes in finding beauty, and that
                    excelling takes a combination of perspective and grit. As someone who got into computers by counting
                    the number of job postings in the newspaper, he loves building things — a product, a community, or a
                    company — and the process of acquiring the knowledge to do so.</p>

                            <p>So, the firefighters are in your data center, this is not a drill. There is no
                                electricity, and the pager is more like a DDoS attack on your phone. You look at your
                                watch, multiple thoughts running through your head. Why me? Why now? How do you pull the
                                team out and through this catastrophe?</p>
                            <p>In this session we will look at managing a crisis of significant magnitude, where all the
                                organization is impacted and there is no clear path through to resolution. We will
                                review the following: - The culture of a learning organization going into the crisis. -
                                Crisis management “in action” - Running a blameless post mortem - Creating tools for
                                high engagement to support the crisis manager. During the presentation we will share
                                real life events, such as a data center going dark with real firefighters coming to the
                                rescue, and production services in the cloud that stop responding.</p>

                                        - BARAK:</strong>“Trying is the first step towards failure”, said the great
                                    Homer Simpson and I would add that “Failing is the first step towards
                                    success”.<br />
                                    I’ve been around software since 2006, in various companies and positions, from C4
                                    system for intercepting rockets through E-commerce and Ad-Tech.<br />
                                    I'm always keen to learn new technologies and test them to see how far to the edge I
                                    can take them. I practice this passion by day at Taboola with our team of rockstars,
                                    while by night I spend time on my second passion - brewing my own beer.</span></p>

                            <p>Github Copilot and tools that help us code better are cool. But I’m lucky if I spend 90
                                minutes a day writing code. We really need to optimize the hours we spend reviewing
                                code, updating tickets and tracing where our code is deployed. Learn how I save an hour
                                a day streamlining non-coding tasks.</p>
                            <p>This talk is unique because 99% of developer productivity tools and hacks are about
                                coding faster, better, smarter. And yet the vast majority of our time is spent doing all
                                of this other stuff. After I started focusing on optimizing the 10 hours I spend every
                                day on non-coding tasks, I found I my productivity went up and my frustration at
                                annoying stuff went way down.

                                I cover how to save time by reducing cognitive load and by cutting menial, non-coding
                                tasks that we have to perform 10-50 times every day. For example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bug or hotfix comes through and you want to start working on it right away so you
                                    create a branch and start fixing. What you don’t do is create a Jira ticket but then
                                    later your boss/PM/CSM yells at your due to lack of visibility. I share how I
                                    automated ticket creation in Slack by correlating Github to Jira.</li>

                                <li>You have 20 minutes until your next meeting and you open a pull request and start a
                                    review. But you get pulled away half way through and when you come back the next day
                                    you forgot everything and have to start over. Huge waste of time. I share an ML job
                                    I wrote that tells me how long the review will take so I can pick PRs that fit the
                                    amount of time I have.</li>

                                <li>You build. You ship it. You own it. Great. But after I merge my code I never know
                                    where it actually is. Did the CI job fail? Is it release under feature flag? Did it
                                    just go GA to everyone? I share a bot I wrote that personally tells me where my code
                                    is in the pipeline after it leaves my hands so I can actually take full ownership
                                    without spending tons of time figuring out what code is in what release.</li>

                                    Hello! I’m Ori Keren, CEO and Co-founder at LinearB. I got my first coding job in
                                    1999 and eventually became VP of Engineering for multiple start-ups before starting
                                    my own company. Before all that, my first experience programming was in Basic. In
                                    1987 I was in 5th grade. My parents bought me a Sinclair Spectrum ZX with 48k RAM. I
                                    vividly remember the day I got that machine. A fire lit inside me and it never went
                                    away :-) That’s why I do this job.</span></p>

                            <p>When it comes to data solutions, one-size doesn’t fit all. Choosing the right
                                best-matching database, or data tools, can be a game changer for your system. How can
                                you take such decision effectively? The system, the company, the product, and probably
                                your team - all are evolving, and the best solution for today may not fit tomorrow’s
                                needs. In order to pick a data solution for longer term, you should evaluate the
                                optional data tools according to several factors. These factors will reflect the
                                requirements looking forward.</p>

                            <p>At this session, we will share such use case, of evaluating data solution, when we
                                redesigned one of Oribi features from scratch. Our goal was to avoid a data explosion
                                crisis, while the system kept scaling up. Having so many solutions out there - we needed
                                to make sure that we are choosing the one that will support the increasing load
                                farthest.</p>

                            <p>Eventually we picked up ten criteria factors, which we used to compare and choose the
                                best solution effectively. Join the session to hear what were these factors, and get
                                prepared for choosing the next data solution for your system.</p>

                            <p>The word observable entered the English language roughly 400 years ago, but the concepts
                                of what it means to see, comprehend, and understand something have been debated since
                                time immemorial. Starting in the 19th century, a series of postulates and criteria
                                coalesced into control theory, and it is from this body of knowledge that we gained the
                                word “observability”. Today, with the advent of complex, interconnected computer
                                systems, that word has taken on new meanings and connotations—some useful, some
                                detrimental, and some just plain confusing.</p>

                            <p>In this talk, we’ll mix a little history, a touch of philosophy, and a healthy dose of
                                reality, to demystify what observability means to us as professional computer people.
                                We’ll tear through the marketing material and unearth foundational principles that will
                                help us to build better infrastructure, write better software, and promote healthier
                                business practices. Finally, we’ll explore some potential new avenues for discussion and
                                understanding.</p>

                            <p>If operations is a classic big data problem, cloud Operations is a *huge* data problem.
                                We all understand the volume of logs, alerts and metrics generated by SaaS applications,
                                and the increasing complexity of hybrid infrastructure, requires you to step up your
                                monitoring strategy and just like any other big data problem – it only makes sense to
                                leverage AI to achieve the observability imperative.</p>

                            <p>Taking into consideration the sheer volume of IT monitoring data that you have to deal
                                with each and every day as DevOps, IT or SRE- leveraging traditional, reactive
                                monitoring tools and approaches wont cut it much longer. Infusing AI is not about
                                magically identifying and automatically solving all your problems, but given the
                                criticality of delivering a phenomenal user experience for SaaS- you can leverage
                                machine learning models to provide you with insights-rather than data- to not only
                                effectively detect abnormal behaviors but also to predict potential issues, map them to

                            <p>Building and operating a global cloud infrastructure at a large scale is a complex task
                                with hundreds of ever-evolving service components. I am happy to share with you some
                                real-world examples of how AI is leveraged at Azure Marketplace and Linkedin scale to
                                monitor wisely, predict capacity and save costs so you can think how you can take it
                                home, and apply it in your production environments.

                            <p>“Being oncall sucks. But it doesn’t have to!” We all heard this one before. Why is it
                                though, that oncall still remains the biggest scar for many? What can a modern
                                Engineering org do to rein the oncall dragons, and actually help people grow as
                                professionals as they go oncall?</p>

                            <p>In this talk, I will present the main reasons why oncall is difficult in modern orgs, and
                                describe ways to mitigate these hardships. The idea is that oncall is often the
                                ‘backroom’ of an org, where all the technical and organizational debt take their toll.
                                Be it unwieldy systems or broken processes between teams, oncall checks all the ‘weak
                                boxes’. Therefore, the only way to win at oncall is to sort out your debts, starting
                                with the organizational ones.</p>

                            <p>I will dive into the detail of the oncall rotation at Snyk as the org scaled from 1 to
                                220 people, what worked well about it, and what was less than perfect. I will discuss
                                the decisions made to turn oncall into a building block of the org, and show a path to
                                rein oncall in your organization as well.</p>

                                and tools, each with its own API, SDK, agent and collectors.</p>

                            <p>In this talk I will present OpenTelemetry, an ambitious open source project with the
                                promise of a unified framework for collecting observability data. With OpenTelemetry you
                                could instrument your application in a vendor-agnostic way, and then analyze the
                                telemetry data in your backend tool of choice, whether Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, or
                                others.</p>

                            <p>I will cover the current state of the various projects of OpenTelemetry (across

                            <p>With the increasing complexity of modern applications, continuous profiling methods and
                                tools are gaining popularity among the Developer and Engineering communities. In this
                                session, we cover what continuous profiling entails and why you should implement a
                                profiler into your tech stack (if you haven’t done so already). We’ll then bring theory
                                to practice and demonstrate a real-life scenario using gProfiler, a free open-source
                                continuous profiling tool, covering Linux servers on multiple architectures (such as
                                Graviton).</p>

        <p>Anyone who has tried to manage access permissions in cloud environments knows how complicated it can be. 
            So it’s no surprise that, according to Gartner, by 2023, 99% of cloud security failures will be the customer’s fault -- 
            and 75% of those will result from inadequate management of identities, access and privileges. 
            In this workshop you’ll learn the fundamentals of IAM in AWS and Azure as well as hands on demonstrations and best practices
            for managing IAM in order to achieve least privilege access.</p>

        <p>Session 1 - Introduction and AWS IAM</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Why is this an issue?</li>
            <li>The interaction between managed policies, inline policies, resource-based policies, and ACL.</li>
            <li>The relationships between roles, groups, permission boundaries, and service control policies.</li>
            <li>How to use AWS tools including Access Advisor, Policy Simulator and Access Analyzer 
                to understand the access available for users, applications and resources</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Session 2 - Azure IAM</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How resources in Azure are structured, and how roles and role assignments are used 
                with different identities to grant access to them.</li>
            <li>How access restriction mechanisms, such as resource locks and deny assignments, actually work.</li>
            <li>How to use Azure tools such as Access Review and Privileged Identity Management 
                as well as other security best practices</li>
        </ul>

                        <p>Security people say users are the weakest link. But are they? When complying with security
                            becomes too burdensome, users take shortcuts, find workarounds, and end up jeopardizing
                            security. Blaming users is lazy and easy. Making security usable is time consuming and
                            challenging. How does design research help us understand our customers? What patterns and
                            principles drive secure behavior? How can we build empathy with customers and make the right
                            thing to do the easiest thing to do? This session explores these questions, and provides
                            examples of how design thinking and research can help us be more secure. We will walk
                            through our creation of core user personas, design principles, and how these inform and
                            direct our design choices and intent. Don’t blame your users anymore. Come learn how to be
                            part of a future where usability leads security.</p>

                        <p>Have you ever felt you took every wrong turn possible in the process of mitigating a
                            production incident? Did you go through a 3-hour hell during incident response and felt the
                            incident wasn’t complex enough to justify the horrors you’ve experienced? Did it cause you
                            to question your engineering or problem-solving skills?</p>

                        <p>Well, it’s only partially you. Our brain is wired to make decision-making simpler. In doing
                            so, it exposes itself to biases, heuristics, and other quirks that may seem like “bad
                            decisions” in hindsight.</p>

                        <p>In this talk, through real-life outages, we’ll project those psychological principles onto
                            the world of production monitor, and incident management. As a responder, you’ll learn why
                            those behavioral patterns emerge during production incidents and what can be done to limit
                            their effect, and as a manager, you’ll learn how to enable and encourage a healthy
                            environment to better support those patterns.</p>

                            gender and ethnicity bias? Nearly impossible. At this talk we will show our tools and

                        <p>About 2 years ago we faced a crisis in our DevOps consulting company - the market demand was
                            higher than we could supply. The traditional recruiting process depending on CV and
                            artificial credentials was not working. So we came up with an alternative solution, and
                            since then - we are growing exponentially and diversely. In this talk we will show the
                            practical tools we deployed in order to increase our capacity, and we will show how these
                            tools overcome the inherited bias in the process.</p>

                <p>When writing code there are many common repetitive tasks that we need to write but don't want to
                    invent ourselves, such as CRUD operations, http client etc. There are of course many frameworks and
                    packages that we can use and rely on but we need to learn how to use them. So in most cases for
                    implementing common operations and patterns we find ourselves searching in Google.</p>

                <p>With very basic string syntax we search for what we are looking for and usually the search engine
                    will give us back a Stack Overflow solution. In most cases we will copy and paste it (or some
                    similar version of it) to our IDE. This process is time consuming, error prone and distracting, we
                    lose our focus and context every time we leave the IDE to the browser and make decisions on our code
                    that might be risky. However, relying on the knowledge of the developer community is important and
                    very helpful for all of us.</p>

                <p>So Instead of searching on the web for solutions, it seems that integrating stack overflow inside
                    our IDE will make developers more efficient and less likely to make mistakes. With the continued
                    growth of technology, prediction tools such as Intellij and AI systems a new line of developer tools
                    emerges such as CoPilot , Kite and TabNine that are going to shape the future of developers. These
                    tools have an AI engine that is able to give code suggestions for whole lines or entire functions
                    right inside the IDE based on simple sentences.</p>

                <p>This might sound scary for many of us developers, as it's going to change the way we work but I
                    actually think it's exciting. In my talk I am going to share with you a bit more details about these
                    tools and how they work and why I think all of us should take part in shaping our future.

                    <br />

                        been working hard on improving npm’s CI/CD process moving from old tools and manual scripts to a
                        fully automated CI/CD flow using GitHub. In this process we have learned a lot and I will try in
                        my talk to share those learning and give our best practices.

            <h4>ABSTRACT:</h4>
            <p>Fifteen years ago, we'd barely started to use S3, and ten years ago DevOps was the new thing. Today, we
                can add a new tool, technology, or trick every week, and more and more work is shifted into the
                application developer's workflow. If security, resiliency, and incident response become part of product
                teams, where will we be ten years from now, and what should we do today to get ready?
            </p>
            <strong>BIO:</strong>
            <small>
                <p>Ellen is Founder in Residence at boldstart Ventures. She joined the boldstart team in January 2021,
                    after having worked with the team as a founder at Dark. Her role allows her to do exactly what she
                    loves – some investing and hands-on support for founders building pre-product, dev-focused,
                    enterprise companies.</p>

                <p>Prior to boldstart and founding Dark, she worked at Blade as an EIR, seeding the work for what became
                    Lola. She also worked on backer-facing projects at Kickstarter and on the first versions of Office
                    for non-Microsoft phone platforms. The common thread is building tools that help people to do
                    creative work.</p>

                <p>Ellen has an a M.B.A from Harvard Business School, and a B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering
                    from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. She grew up in Rochester Hills, MI, but now lives in
                    Somerville, MA with her husband and her cat, Gutenberg.</p>

                                <p>Many senior technical leaders are struggling with how to make sure that their
                                    infrastructure, code and architecture can support the business needs. The challenge
                                    is not WHAT should be done, but how to promote these tasks, how to create a unified
                                    backlog that everyone agrees on, and how to keep the right communication level with
                                    the company’s CEO, VP Product and other non-technical managers. These aspects of the
                                    system, includes security, scaling, supportability, debuggability, it's up time and
                                    more.</p>
                                <p> As a senior engineering manager, your role is to manage and prioritize these
                                    required changes as a backlog that must be tightly aligned with the company’s
                                    business needs. </p>

                                <p> In this workshop, we will understand how to manage all the technical items that can
                                    enable your business growth, what the preferred method to create the right balance
                                    for your own company is, and how to make everyone in your organization follow the
                                    same decision-making process. By gaining these techniques, you will be able to not
                                    only provide a clear technical roadmap to your system, but also communicate it well
                                    to the business people, to keep everyone on the same page for your team’s plans for
                                    next year.</p>

                            <p>CI/CD pipelines are quickly becoming the path of least resistance for would-be attackers
                                into sensitive internal systems, gaining access to critical data, with minimal effort.
                            </p>

                            <p>In the InfoSec world when we talk about CI/CD security often times this focuses on
                                specific aspects of securing your pipeline - scanning the code, protecting secrets,
                                securely managing code deployments, or even authentication and authorization mechanisms,
                                but we rarely talk about all of these together.</p>

                            <p>After years of being in the trenches and realizing that the attack surface is growing and
                                the threat landscape becoming more and more complex, it has become increasingly apparent
                                that security teams need to adapt and modify strategies to keep up with the new reality
                                of CI/CD protection, without compromising developer velocity.</p>

                            <p>In this talk I would like to propose a new way of thinking about CI/CD security - that
                                encompasses the three disciplines that comprise CI/CD security - security in the
                                pipeline, of the pipeline, and around the pipeline. Partial coverage of any or all of
                                these disciplines simply will not cut it with the continuously evolving risk landscape.
                                Security engineers need to address each of these aspects in their entirety to provide
                                the full scope of coverage that modern organizations need, and I will take a deep dive

                            <p>In your ever-changing Infrastructure, some changes are intentional while others are not.
                            </p>
                            <p>Drift is what happens whenever the real-world state of your infrastructure differs from
                                the state defined in your configuration. This can happen for many reasons, sometimes it
                                happens when adding or removing resources, other times when changing resource
                                definitions upon resource termination or failure, and even when changes have been made
                                manually or via other automation tools.
                            </p>
                            <p>While Terraform itself can detect drifts, in most cases, you will be informed about it
                                too late: just before you are about to deploy new changes to your infrastructure. What’s
                                interesting about Terraform though, is that you can apply changes in two separate and
                                distinct steps of “Planning” and “Applying”. This means that you have full visibility of
                                what Terraform is planning on doing beforehand, and if you are satisfied with the
                                changes, you can choose to apply them.
                            </p>
                            <p>So how does this work? When something is changed intentionally, it will appear in the
                                source code, and the Terraform plan will not do anything. However, if any part of the
                                infrastructure has been changed manually, Terraform’s plan will identify this, and alert
                                you to the change. In other words, if your IaC drifted from its expected state, then
                                Terraform’s plan will, in fact, detect it.
                            </p>
                            <p>Applying this simple solution can empower DevOps and developer velocity, with the
                                reassurance and context for unexpected changes in your IaC, in near real-time. This talk
                                will showcase real-world examples, and practical ways to apply this in your production
                                environments while doing so safely and at the pace of your engineering cycles.

                            <p>In every development process there is the question, do we invest enough on quality? Do we
                                need to invest more? Every team knows about the dilemma of how many tests is the right
                                amount of tests we should write. Is 80% test coverage is good enough? Maybe 90%? 100%?
                                Should we invest more time in unit testing? Are we wasting too much time on
                                unit-testing? Should we invest time on a faster rollback mechanism?</p>

                            <p>In this talk, I will share my journey onboarding remotely in the midst of a global
                                pandemic.
                                I will talk about the tips that worked for me, how I was able to be productive,
                                impactful, and make a good impression on others.
                                The key issues as an “onbordee” that I will talk about are how to create relationships,
                                make yourself visible in the company, time management, and more.</p>
                            <p>Since I started working in Augury over 100 new employees have joined the company.
                                Each month I give a session that is part of their general onboarding process.
                                This became a crucial step due to the fact that we are now a hybrid company
                                and a lot of people are onboarding remotely or in a hybrid setup for the first time in
                                their lives. </p>
                            <p>I joined the company as a backend developer and a few months into my role,
                                the squad leader position in my squad was up for grabs and I was fortunate enough to
                                grab it :)
                                This is my first official leadership role, which I also needed to onboard into in a
                                hybrid setup.
                                I will share the process that I built for myself on “How to lead”.
                                Also, a word or two on the process we built as a squad on how we work in a hybrid setup,
                                what are we optimizing for when we do meet and how to include new members of the team.

                                continuity. In the session I will share Next Insurance’s journey - where we started,
                                where we are now and what we learned on the way so far. I will talk about how we managed
                                to build our proven DR plans, and actually execute them in our DR drills. I will also
                                talk about why we decided that the only way to prove your DR plan works is to continue
                                running your business in the DR account and make it your production account, and go on
                                to build your next DR account. If you are a part of a company that is about to embark on
                                a similar journey, this session might equip you with some very useful insights on how to
                                think about such a challenge, and some very useful and practical tips on how to execute
                                it.</p>

                            <p>Configuration Management is at the core of Ops. It’s the biggest enabler of any compute
                                operation, small and big. In the past decade, we have switched from thinking about the
                                machines we are configuring, to think about the software and services we are
                                controlling. With that change of mindset, so did the tools we are using. Traditional
                                tools like Puppet, chef, salt and Ansible are slowly declining while new tools such as
                                Terraform, Pulumi, Helm and Kustomize are on the rise. In this talk I will try to
                                describe the pain-points and the opportunities of this transformation as well as
                                suggesting a future direction based on tools developed at the big-tech companies (Mainly
                                facebook and google)</p>

                        <p>In the past few years, I’ve been on a quest to build a better configuration management tool,
                            trying to learn how different companies implementing their configuration strategies. I am
                            evaluating how configuration is being described, composed, delivered and consumed while
                            developing <a href="https://protoconf.github.io/protoconf" target="_blank">protoconf</a>.
                            I’ve started protoconf because I missed the configuration tool I used while at facebook (<a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/holistic-configuration-management-at-facebook/" target="_blank">configerator</a>). I feel like more people need to know about how
                            big-tech companies approach configuration.

                            <p>So you built your Next.js or other Node.js apps and containerized them, great job! But
                                what does it take to secure a container? Are you sure you’re following all the best
                                practices to build container images correctly? What are the threats you are not
                                mitigating in a running container? There’s no better way to understand container
                                security than seeing some live hacking! Join me to learn and adopt best practices of
                                running secure containerized applications in production.

                            <p>From idea to execution, the challenges of publishing an open source project are very
                                similar to initializing a startup when it comes to creating a successful product that
                                people will love and use.</p>

                            <p> Most open source projects are not “taking-off”, although they are really good! This is
                                because developers (which are usually the creators of open source projects) think that
                                writing the code is the hard part and “neglect” the other parts of publishing a good
                                open source project.</p>

                            <p>In this talk, I will use my experience as a contributor to open source and product head
                                of a startup, to go beyond writing the code itself and cover the other central aspects
                                of creating an open source project, like MVP, product/market fit, marketing and more.

                                In this talk, I will remind you of some of the pain points you have probably experienced when using
                                REST. I will then explain what GraphQL is and demonstrate how it solves these pain points. Next, I
                                will discuss the disadvantages of GraphQL. Finally, I will provide some guidelines for choosing
                                between REST and GraphQL. By the end of this talk, you will understand what GraphQL is and when to
                                use it.<br /></p>

                            <p>“The International Space Station has been orbiting the Earth for over 20 years. It was
                                not launched fully formed, as a monolith in space. Instead, it is built out of dozens of
                                individual modules, each with a dedicated role - life support, engineering, science,
                                commercial applications and more. Each module (or container) functions as a
                                microservice, adding additional capabilities to the whole. Not only do the modules need
                                to function together, delivering both functional and non-functional capabilities, they
                                were designed, developed and built by different countries on Earth and once launched
                                into space (deployed in multiple different ways), had to work together - perfectly.</p>

                            <p>Despite the many (minor) reliability issues which have occurred over the decades, the ISS
                                remains a highly reliable platform for cutting edge scientific and engineering research.
                            </p>

                            <p>In this session I will describe the way the space station was developed and the lessons
                                Site Reliability and DevOps Engineers can learn from it.</p>

                        <p>In this bleak, depressing talk we will discuss some of the ways computer science and computer
                            security has fallen flat on its face, and how you can avoid making the same mistakes, with
                            just a soupçon of humor for good measure.</p>

                        <p>We will break these problems down and hopefully learn some important lessons, such as not
                            allowing your door locks to call system(), how to properly secure your corner of the
                            Internet Of Things, a crash course in processor architectures and how they lie to you, and
                            how the inevitable heat-death of the universe is a result of RSA.</p>

                        <p>Hopefully, you’ll emerge feeling smarter, discussing new topics, and slightly terrified.</p>

                        <p>The last two decades have been all about SaaS, with advantages that cannot be
                            overstated. Except SaaS isn’t always an option, nor is it always the right choice:
                            businesses in tightly regulated industries, or where information security is paramount,
                            for example, will not - often can not - consider any software that isn’t under their
                            control. For many software enterprises, this leads to the dreaded inevitability of
                            on-premise deployment.</p>

                        <p>Fortunately, the situation today is dramatically different to a scant few years ago, let
                            alone a decade or two: the same technologies that enable SaaS have also radically
                            transformed on-prem deployment. Modern tools like Docker, Consul, ELK and Kubernetes -
                            to name a few - can be leveraged to completely transform the experience for both
                            customers and vendors. In this talk we’ll contrast the challenges and advantages of SaaS
                            and on-prem, see how things have evolved in recent history, and see how modern on-prem
                            deployment can be, if not pleasurable, at least relatively painless.</p>

                        <p>One of the hardest challenges data teams face today is selecting which tools to use in
                            their workflow. Marketing messages are vague, and you continuously hear of new buzzwords
                            you “just have to have in your stack”. There is a constant stream of new tools,
                            open-source and proprietary that make buyer’s remorse especially bad. I call it “MLOps
                            Fatigue”.</p>

                        <p>This talk will not discuss a specific MLOps tool, but instead present guidelines and
                            mental models for how to think about the problems you and your team are facing, and how
                            to select the best tools for the task. We will review a few example problems, analyze
                            them, and suggest Open Source solutions for them. We will provide a mental framework
                            that will help tackle future problems you might face and extract the concrete value each
                            tool provides.</p>

                        <h5>What you’ll learn</h5>
                        <p>You’ll learn what signals to watch for to notice you might have MLOps fatigue. How to
                            define the challenge you’re facing and which questions to ask in order to build a
                            “decision tree” for selecting the best-suited tools for the task. A few examples for
                            using this framework in practice on challenges involving data management and automating
                            training/pipeline tasks</p>

                        <p>About 2 years ago we faced a crisis in our DevOps consulting company - the market demand
                            was
                            higher than we could supply. The traditional recruiting process depending on CV and
                            artificial credentials was not working. So we came up with an alternative solution, and
                            since then - we are growing exponentially and diversely. In this talk we will show the
                            practical tools we deployed in order to increase our capacity, and we will show how
                            these
                            tools overcome the inherited bias in the process.</p>

                </summary>
                <p>This is for you, you rockstar, ninja coffee drinking workaholic who doesn’t know what a vacation day
                    looks like. Even though you love your job and are dedicated and are super important, you need a
                    break too.<br />
                    We tend to think that working all the time is an effective practice while the truth is that finding
                    the time for self care and recharging your batteries is beneficial for both you and your company.
                    Additionally, if you’re a leader, you’re responsible for the wellbeing of your team. In this talk
                    I’ll discuss the importance of taking time off of work and creating a positive culture surrounding
                    vacation time.<br />

                        is a wheel. tech is a spiral</span></summary>
                <p>Presenting the concept of spiral history in computer technology, with very little examples. spiral
                    history is a metaphor for how we do the same stuff every few years but they work out a little bit
                    different.<br />
                    “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” or so it is said, in technology and
                    even more specifically in computer science it still holds true, however in computer science it is
                    not exactly repeating and sometimes in our very young field forgetting the past actually helps since
                    what haven’t worked before might work today. 5 minutes for 2 examples of spiral history and i hope
                    you will accept this theory.
