        <div><small><strong>BIO:</strong> I’m coding since 4th grade when my dad taught me BASIC, and I got hooked. From that point, I learned to code in many programming languages (today my favorite is C#). Today I’m working at Soluto by Asurion, and coding is a huge part of my day job. My passion for AppSec started by accident when I was offered the role of security champion. The AppSec journey was (and still is) fascinated, and taught me a lot. OWASP helped me a lot during this journey; This is why I decided to become a paying member and also leading OWASP Glue. My current job is DevSecOps – helping the entire team to produce more secure software. Besides my job, I’m also giving a lot of talks all over the world, and heavy OSS contributor – mainly to Kamus, a secret encryption solution for Kubernetes platform. When I’m not working – I’m enjoying the company of my two beloved kids

        <div><p> <strong>TALK ABSTRACT:</strong> Micro-services are social beings: they can’t function without talking with other services. Every microservice has its own domain, and it usually relies on other micro-services to function properly. But this also raises an interesting question: do we trust all of our micro-services? The truth is that not all micro-services are the same: some micro-services are more sensitive - for example, services that handle user data. Others are user-facing and therefore riskier. We cannot treat all services as equal. We need a good and robust mechanism to describe who can talk with who. At Soluto, we are dealing with this challenge for a while. In this talk, I’ll share the journey we went through until we found a solution we’re happy with: a simple and declarative system that allows services to define who can access them. Any dev can request access to any service, and the service owner can review it. In talk, I’ll share how we build this solution, using open source tools like Open Policy Agent, so you can easily build something similar.

Since there is no out of the box solution we had to build our own. In order to implement SSL for your customers, a complicated security process is needed involving different organizations units for both the client and us. This is how we solved the problem with Letsencrypt, docker, Redis, Nginx, resty-Lua and autossl module.

        <div><p> <strong>TALK ABSTRACT:</strong>             
            The CAP theorem is often used to classify distributed systems, and the “two out of three” rule is often quoted. But the CAP theorem is widely misunderstood. What are the exact terms of the CAP Theorem? How does it differ from Brewer’s original CAP Conjecture? Where does CAP fall short of meeting practical engineering expectations</p>
            <p>Let us review the definitions and proof of the CAP Theorem, see some hidden assumptions, and attempt to apply these to modern distributed systems. We will challenge the common misconception that systems should be defined by CAP properties, or, indeed, that the CAP Theorem model is one to pursue. We discuss the conjecture, the theorem, and what we can expect to achieve in modern distributed systems.</p>
            <p>We will apply logic, math, engineering principals and a pragmatic approach.</p>

            Here’s the Live Action OAuth Theater segment of the talk (5 minutes): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYzf2JBdUM8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYzf2JBdUM8</a> 
            If you’ve ever tried to search for information on OAuth and/or OpenID Connect, you’ve probably encountered deep dive code examples or references to the specifications. The specifications are great if you’re building OAuth from scratch or suffer from insomnia. Many examples focus on just code, rather than concepts.<br />
            These types of resources are not useful for understanding the concepts and historical backdrop for why OAuth and OIDC exist.<br />
            In this talk we start with the foundations of federated and delegated authentication and authorization, work our way through concepts and foundations for OAuth and OIDC and end with some practical demonstrations of the standards in action.</p>

            <p>Tinkering, building and breaking stuff since I was 10 years. I've built several independent projects and filled several positions in which I met the DevOps field in many strange ways, until I finally became an Infrastructure Engineer at monday.com about a year ago, and am meeting new challenges every day.<br />
                Strong believer in knowledge sharing through blog posts, meetups and conferences, and never miss the opportunity to attend a good professional gathering. I also consider myself a good public speaker, and I feel that it's finally my time to give back and share others in the local tech community with my experiences.

        <div><p> <strong>TALK ABSTRACT:</strong>             
            Albeit being a common industry practice, using the same service provider for network security and acceleration (i.e. DDoS mitigation, WAF, CDN) and for DNS can have adverse effects on a production environment when that provider is compromised. When Cloudflare went down for 27 minutes back in July, during peak time, we found ourselves completely helpless, and were resolved to make sure this doesn’t happen again.<br />
            This talk will present the process that we’ve gone through in order migrate our production DNS zone to another provider, starting from the research process of electing a new provider that would suit our needs, through the creation of a playbook with clear checkpoints and a flashing “point-of-no-return” and with the actual execution of that playbook.<br />
            We would touch on key topics such as building a process that we can execute with confidence, including how to fully simulate a migration before actually doing it; how to use IaC tooling to manage DNS in a Multi-DNS architecture; how to monitor the progress of DNS propagation; and, what unexpected surprises we encountered along the way and how we solved them.</p>

In this talk I’ll make an intro to GPU basing on my experience building a production auto-scalable cluster of GPUs for inference of a deep learning model.

            Lets face it - we are all liars. We often lie unintentionally and most of all - we lie to ourselves. I’ve spent the last 10 years working with enterprise architects intent on modernizing their data infrastructure, and I’ve heard many “facts" that turned out to be… less than perfectly accurate. Self-deception about state of the industry, our requirements and our capabilities can lead us to make bad choices, which leads us to build bad architectures and often leads to bad business outcomes.<br />
            If you say or hear phrases like “we have big data”, “we don’t have big data”, “this business app must be real-time” and “hybrid-cloud doesn’t exist” - you may work for an organization that can use a bit of reality check. In this talk, Gwen Shapira, principal data architect at Confluent, will share common enterprise architecture myths that did not survive contact with reality and offer some advice on how to design good data architecture given our inherent capacity for self-deception.</p>

        <div><p> <strong>TALK ABSTRACT:</strong> Many of us use git every day but we don’t really understand how it works. This leads to lots of headaches and messy code bases. Lets dive into git to understand how it all comes together - the objects that make up git, creating the commits that we all know and love, and working with them. What are branches, actually? What happens when we merge and when we rebase? Which one should we choose? Understanding what goes on behind the scenes enables us to get out of the messy git situations we all know (and probably don’t love)… or better yet, to avoid them in the first place! </p></div>

        <div><small><strong>BIO:</strong> I’m coding since 4th grade when my dad taught me BASIC, and I got hooked. From that point, I learned to code in many programming languages (today my favorite is C#). Today I’m working at Soluto by Asurion, and coding is a huge part of my day job. My passion for AppSec started by accident when I was offered the role of security champion. The AppSec journey was (and still is) fascinated, and taught me a lot. OWASP helped me a lot during this journey; This is why I decided to become a paying member and also leading OWASP Glue. My current job is DevSecOps – helping the entire team to produce more secure software. Besides my job, I’m also giving a lot of talks all over the world, and heavy OSS contributor – mainly to Kamus, a secret encryption solution for Kubernetes platform. When I’m not working – I’m enjoying the company of my two beloved kids

        <div><p> <strong>TALK ABSTRACT:</strong> Micro-services are social beings: they can’t function without talking with other services. Every microservice has its own domain, and it usually relies on other micro-services to function properly. But this also raises an interesting question: do we trust all of our micro-services? The truth is that not all micro-services are the same: some micro-services are more sensitive - for example, services that handle user data. Others are user-facing and therefore riskier. We cannot treat all services as equal. We need a good and robust mechanism to describe who can talk with who. At Soluto, we are dealing with this challenge for a while. In this talk, I’ll share the journey we went through until we found a solution we’re happy with: a simple and declarative system that allows services to define who can access them. Any dev can request access to any service, and the service owner can review it. In talk, I’ll share how we build this solution, using open source tools like Open Policy Agent, so you can easily build something similar.

Since there is no out of the box solution we had to build our own. In order to implement SSL for your customers, a complicated security process is needed involving different organizations units for both the client and us. This is how we solved the problem with Letsencrypt, docker, Redis, Nginx, resty-Lua and autossl module.

        <div><p> <strong>TALK ABSTRACT:</strong>             
            The CAP theorem is often used to classify distributed systems, and the “two out of three” rule is often quoted. But the CAP theorem is widely misunderstood. What are the exact terms of the CAP Theorem? How does it differ from Brewer’s original CAP Conjecture? Where does CAP fall short of meeting practical engineering expectations</p>
            <p>Let us review the definitions and proof of the CAP Theorem, see some hidden assumptions, and attempt to apply these to modern distributed systems. We will challenge the common misconception that systems should be defined by CAP properties, or, indeed, that the CAP Theorem model is one to pursue. We discuss the conjecture, the theorem, and what we can expect to achieve in modern distributed systems.</p>
            <p>We will apply logic, math, engineering principals and a pragmatic approach.</p>

            Here’s the Live Action OAuth Theater segment of the talk (5 minutes): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYzf2JBdUM8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYzf2JBdUM8</a> 
            If you’ve ever tried to search for information on OAuth and/or OpenID Connect, you’ve probably encountered deep dive code examples or references to the specifications. The specifications are great if you’re building OAuth from scratch or suffer from insomnia. Many examples focus on just code, rather than concepts.<br />
            These types of resources are not useful for understanding the concepts and historical backdrop for why OAuth and OIDC exist.<br />
            In this talk we start with the foundations of federated and delegated authentication and authorization, work our way through concepts and foundations for OAuth and OIDC and end with some practical demonstrations of the standards in action.</p>

        <div><small><strong>BIO:</strong> 
            <p>Tinkering, building and breaking stuff since I was 10 years. I've built several independent projects and filled several positions in which I met the DevOps field in many strange ways, until I finally became an Infrastructure Engineer at monday.com about a year ago, and am meeting new challenges every day.<br />
                Strong believer in knowledge sharing through blog posts, meetups and conferences, and never miss the opportunity to attend a good professional gathering. I also consider myself a good public speaker, and I feel that it's finally my time to give back and share others in the local tech community with my experiences.

        <div><p> <strong>TALK ABSTRACT:</strong>             
            Albeit being a common industry practice, using the same service provider for network security and acceleration (i.e. DDoS mitigation, WAF, CDN) and for DNS can have adverse effects on a production environment when that provider is compromised. When Cloudflare went down for 27 minutes back in July, during peak time, we found ourselves completely helpless, and were resolved to make sure this doesn’t happen again.<br />
            This talk will present the process that we’ve gone through in order migrate our production DNS zone to another provider, starting from the research process of electing a new provider that would suit our needs, through the creation of a playbook with clear checkpoints and a flashing “point-of-no-return” and with the actual execution of that playbook.<br />
            We would touch on key topics such as building a process that we can execute with confidence, including how to fully simulate a migration before actually doing it; how to use IaC tooling to manage DNS in a Multi-DNS architecture; how to monitor the progress of DNS propagation; and, what unexpected surprises we encountered along the way and how we solved them.</p>

In this talk I’ll make an intro to GPU basing on my experience building a production auto-scalable cluster of GPUs for inference of a deep learning model.

            Our customers need branded URL in order to support their brand and increase click-through rate. The world is becoming secured and HTTPS is a must. Since there is no out of the box solution we had to build our own. In order to implement SSL for your customers, a complicated security process is needed involving different organizations units for both the client and us. This is how we solved the problem with Letsencrypt, docker, Redis, Nginx, resty-Lua and autossl module.

            Lets face it - we are all liars. We often lie unintentionally and most of all - we lie to ourselves. I’ve spent the last 10 years working with enterprise architects intent on modernizing their data infrastructure, and I’ve heard many “facts" that turned out to be… less than perfectly accurate. Self-deception about state of the industry, our requirements and our capabilities can lead us to make bad choices, which leads us to build bad architectures and often leads to bad business outcomes.<br />
            If you say or hear phrases like “we have big data”, “we don’t have big data”, “this business app must be real-time” and “hybrid-cloud doesn’t exist” - you may work for an organization that can use a bit of reality check. In this talk, Gwen Shapira, principal data architect at Confluent, will share common enterprise architecture myths that did not survive contact with reality and offer some advice on how to design good data architecture given our inherent capacity for self-deception.</p>
