In order to bring the community together, even if it's just in a virtual capacity, until we can get to operations as usual (or as close to usual as possible) - we have decided to put together the funnest, mostly easily consumable event possible.  We know that most of us are working from home, juggling family care, and other distractions - and wanted to ensure the event can fit into a realistic day in the new normal.

<h2>What we're looking for</h2>
<p>The event's agenda will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ONE KEYNOTE</strong> for each event <strong>(4 Total)</strong></li>
<li><strong>IGNITES</strong> to follow each keynote, corresponding to the event's content, depeding on volume - there may be sufficient for a track in English & Hebrew, show us what you got!</li>
<li><strong>SPONSOR TRACK</strong> a full day of ignites introducing new tooling, open source projects, and demoing new functionality.</li>
</ul>


<h4>~/ talk formats</h4>
This year’s talk formats include:
<ul>
<li><strong>KEYNOTE.</strong> 40-Minute deep dives & advanced technical talks</li>
<li><strong>IGNITE.</strong> A 5-Minute Talk with 20 slides (we won't be sticklers about the auto-progress) </li>
</ul>
 

<h4>Suggested Topics</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>DEVOPSDAYS TEL AVIV</strong> covers the intersection between development and operations, with a focus on the culture, core technologies, systems, protocols & principles that are the backbone of <strong>scalable, resilient, robust, and secure systems.</strong></li>
<li><strong>STATSCRAFT</strong> is focused on helping engineers understand how to make monitoring easier for humans with content that dives into the tools & methods, insights on how to derive more from your data, and ensuring systems are built to empower and enable <strong>the humans behind them to have a good quality of life.</strong></li>
<li><strong>CLOUD NATIVE DAY TEL AVIV</strong> is the mirror image of DevOpsDays Tel Aviv, where the focus is indeed on modern <strong>cloud native tool chains, open source projects that power the cloud native world, serverless, containers, networking, service mesh and more.</strong></li>
<li><strong>DEVSECCON TEL AVIV</strong> covers DevSecOps, Application Security, Cloud Native Security, shift left, and any topics related to applying end-to-end security and continuously secure software delivery <strong> in modern engineering organizations.</strong></li>
<li><strong>DEVREL IL</strong> is everything about <strong>developer relations & developer community building best practices.</strong></li>

</ul>


<h4>~/ guidelines - The Finer Print</h4>
<ul>
<li>Talks may be submitted in either Hebrew or English, depending on the volume & quality of talks received, we will decide if there is enough for two tracks.</li>
<li>We are looking to be <em>better together</em>, so talks that combine more than one focus topic will receive priority for acceptance.</li>
<li>We welcome new and seasoned speakers, so please don't hesitate to submit even if you are new to the stage.  The moderation team will be happy to provide you with guidance and mentoring.</li>
<li>All presentations must conform to the <a href="/code-of-conduct.html" target="_blank">code of conduct.</a>.</li>
<li>No third-party submissions. All speakers must login and submit their own talks.</li>
<li>We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you’re in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, in a large, traditional organization, or the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.</li>
<li>No vendor pitches. We value vendors and sponsors, however we cannot accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.</li>
</ul>
