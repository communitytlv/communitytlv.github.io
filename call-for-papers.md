In order to bring the community together, even if it's just in a virtual capacity, until we can get to operations as usual (or as close to usual as possible) - we have decided to put together the funnest, mostly easily consumable event possible.  We know that most of us are working from home, juggling family care, and other distractions - and wanted to ensure the event can fit into a realistic day in the new normal.

<h2>What we're looking for</h2>
<p>The event's agenda will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ONE KEYNOTE</strong> for each event <strong>(4 Total)</strong></li>
<li><strong>IGNITES</strong> to follow each keynote, corresponding to the event's content, depeding on volume - there may be sufficient for a track in English & Hebrew, show us what you got!</li>
<li><strong>SPONSOR TRACK</strong> a full day of ignites introducing new tooling, open source projects, and demoing new functionality.</li>
</ul>


<h4>The Finer Print</h4>
<ul>
<li>Talks may be submitted in either Hebrew or English, depending on the volume & quality of talks received, we will decide if there is enough for two tracks.</li>
<li>We are looking to be <em>better together</em>, so talks that combine more than one focus topic will receive priority for acceptance.</li>
<li>We welcome new and seasoned speakers, so please don't hesitate to submit even if you are new to the stage.  The moderation team will be happy to provide you with guidance and mentoring.</li>

</ul>


<h4>Suggested Topics</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>DEVOPSDAYS TEL AVIV</strong> the intersection between development and operations, with a focus on the culture, core technologies, systems, protocols & principles that are the backbone of <strong>scalable, resilient, robust, and secure systems.</strong></li>
<li><strong>STATSCRAFT</strong> is focused on helping engineers understand how to make monitoring easier for humans with content that dives into the tools & methods, insights on how to derive more from your data, and ensuring systems are built to empower and enable <strong>the humans behind them to have a good quality of life.</strong></li>
<li><strong>CLOUD NATIVE DAY TEL AVIV</strong> is the mirror image of DevOpsDays Tel Aviv, where the focus is indeed on modern <strong>cloud native tool chains, open source projects that power the cloud native world, serverless, containers, networking, service mesh and more.</strong></li>
<li><strong>DEVSECON TEL AVIV</strong> the intersection between development and operations, with a focus on the culture, core technologies, systems, protocols & principles that are the backbone of <strong>scalable, resilient, robust, and secure systems.</strong></li>
