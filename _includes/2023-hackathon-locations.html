                                    your team - all are evolving, and the best
                                    solution for today may not fit tomorrow’s
                                    needs. In order to pick a data solution for
                                    longer term, you should evaluate the
                                    optional data tools according to several
                                    factors. These factors will reflect the
                                    requirements looking forward.</p>

                                <p>At this session, we will share such use case,
                                    of evaluating data solution, when we
                                    redesigned one of Oribi features from
                                    scratch. Our goal was to avoid a data
                                    explosion
                                    crisis, while the system kept scaling up.
                                    Having so many solutions out there - we
                                    needed
                                    to make sure that we are choosing the one
                                    that will support the increasing load
                                    farthest.</p>

                                <p>Eventually we picked up ten criteria factors,
                                    which we used to compare and choose the
                                    best solution effectively. Join the session
                                    to hear what were these factors, and get
                                    prepared for choosing the next data solution
                                    for your system.</p>

                                    TALK: PRINCIPLES OF OBSERVABILITY</h4>

                                <p>The word observable entered the English
                                    language roughly 400 years ago, but the
                                    concepts
                                    of what it means to see, comprehend, and
                                    understand something have been debated
                                    since
                                    time immemorial. Starting in the 19th
                                    century, a series of postulates and criteria
                                    coalesced into control theory, and it is
                                    from this body of knowledge that we gained
                                    the
                                    word “observability”. Today, with the advent
                                    of complex, interconnected computer
                                    systems, that word has taken on new meanings
                                    and connotations—some useful, some
                                    detrimental, and some just plain confusing.</p>
                                <p>In this talk, we’ll mix a little history, a
                                    touch of philosophy, and a healthy dose
                                    of
                                    reality, to demystify what observability
                                    means to us as professional computer
                                    people.
                                    We’ll tear through the marketing material
                                    and unearth foundational principles that
                                    will
                                    help us to build better infrastructure,
                                    write better software, and promote healthier
                                    business practices. Finally, we’ll explore
                                    some potential new avenues for discussion
                                    and
                                    understanding.</p>
