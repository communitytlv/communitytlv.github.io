                                link. But are they? When complying with
                                security becomes too burdensome, users take
                                shortcuts, find workarounds, and end up
                                jeopardizing security. Blaming users is lazy and
                                easy. Making security usable is time
                                consuming and challenging. How does design
                                research help us understand our customers?
                                What patterns and principles drive secure
                                behavior? How can we build empathy with
                                customers and make the right thing to do the
                                easiest thing to do? This session explores
                                these questions, and provides examples of how
                                design thinking and research can help us
                                be more secure. We will walk through our
                                creation of core user personas, design
                                principles, and how these inform and direct our
                                design choices and intent. Don’t blame
                                your users anymore. Come learn how to be part of
                                a future where usability leads

                                    data solution for your system</h4>

                                <p>When it comes to data solutions, one-size
                                    doesn’t fit all. Choosing the right
                                    best-matching database, or data tools, can
                                    be a game changer for your system. How
                                    can
                                    you take such decision effectively? The
                                    system, the company, the product, and
                                    probably
                                    your team - all are evolving, and the best
                                    solution for today may not fit tomorrow’s
                                    needs. In order to pick a data solution for
                                    longer term, you should evaluate the
                                    optional data tools according to several
                                    factors. These factors will reflect the
                                    requirements looking forward.</p>

                                <p>At this session, we will share such use case,
                                    of evaluating data solution, when we
                                    redesigned one of Oribi features from
                                    scratch. Our goal was to avoid a data
                                    explosion
                                    crisis, while the system kept scaling up.
                                    Having so many solutions out there - we
                                    needed
                                    to make sure that we are choosing the one
                                    that will support the increasing load
                                    farthest.</p>

                                <p>Eventually we picked up ten criteria factors,
                                    which we used to compare and choose the
                                    best solution effectively. Join the session
                                    to hear what were these factors, and get
                                    prepared for choosing the next data solution
                                    for your system.</p>

                                    TALK: PRINCIPLES OF OBSERVABILITY</h4>

                                <p>The word observable entered the English
                                    language roughly 400 years ago, but the
                                    concepts
                                    of what it means to see, comprehend, and
                                    understand something have been debated
                                    since
                                    time immemorial. Starting in the 19th
                                    century, a series of postulates and criteria
                                    coalesced into control theory, and it is
                                    from this body of knowledge that we gained
                                    the
                                    word “observability”. Today, with the advent
                                    of complex, interconnected computer
                                    systems, that word has taken on new meanings
                                    and connotations—some useful, some
                                    detrimental, and some just plain confusing.</p>
                                <p>In this talk, we’ll mix a little history, a
                                    touch of philosophy, and a healthy dose
                                    of
                                    reality, to demystify what observability
                                    means to us as professional computer
                                    people.
                                    We’ll tear through the marketing material
                                    and unearth foundational principles that
                                    will
                                    help us to build better infrastructure,
                                    write better software, and promote healthier
                                    business practices. Finally, we’ll explore
                                    some potential new avenues for discussion
                                    and
                                    understanding.</p>
