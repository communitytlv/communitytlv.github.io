                                <p>"Not my job!"<br/> "Developers never listen" <br/>"We tried DevOps last year"<br/>

                                    DevOps can help your organization become an innovation machine where people thrive, but the path to DevOps can be quite painful if the organization is not aligned.
                                    
                                    As a CTO I try to be the T-shaped member that can relay business value to executives and identify  technical hurdles with developers. I have invested in transparency across the company in the journey towards DevOps, because it's never just to just introduce or "roll it out" - it is agile transformation.
                                    
                                    Find the structure of the DevOps change process and make people across the full organization care about it and celebrate it together.</p>

                            The future of cloud-native and modern application development: 25 years of perspective</h4>
                        <div style="text-transform: uppercase;"></div>
                        <div><small>10 years ago we heard that "software is eating the world" and now more we’re seeing containers do the same thing – rapidly changing established patterns of software development, while disrupting entire companies and industries. The container abstraction has made it possible to build, test and deploy applications that run consistently and reliably – and to move them between compute environments with better isolation and security. Yet this revolution is just getting started, with most technology spending still on-prem. Many business applications owners struggle to put advances like microservices, service mesh & CI/CD into practice; and securing the software “supply chain” is as complex as ever.

 

                            Joshua Burgin was “in the room where it happened” over the last 25 years, and he will take you on a dive deep into the evolution of software and hardware abstractions, and offer some predictions about the coming decade – supported by real world examples from his days as one of the first 100 employees of Amazon.com, to his time at Zynga, AWS and now VMware Tanzu. 
                            
                             
                            
                            Joshua will cover how pervasive containerization will transform not just how software gets written and deployed, but how databases, networking and security are done. He’ll also explore the breadth and depth of personal and professional opportunity that remains to transform the way enterprises, governments, and businesses of all sizes use technology to fulfill their missions.</small></div>

                                Joshua Burgin is the VP of Product & Technical Strategy for the Tanzu Platform at VMWare. In this position he helps developers modernize their applications and embrace cloud-native patterns like microservices, containers, DevOps, and Kubernetes. Prior to joining VMWare in 2022, he spent 7.5 years at AWS in a variety of executive roles, most recently as the General Manager for AWS Outposts business, responsible for engineering, product management, design, marketing and business development. Before Outposts, Joshua worked as Chief of Staff & Technical Advisor to AWS’s most senior executives – Charlie Bell and Andy Jassy – tracking key industry trends, formulating strategy, and developing in-depth solutions to business & technical challenges. From 2014-2019, Joshua was a Director/General Manager in Compute Services – as well as the sponsor for 3 successful acquisitions (ClusterK, Thinkbox, Nimble Software). Prior to AWS, he held product and technology executive roles at several startups, including Zynga, where he drove the development of their in-game advertising platform.

                        <h4 style="text-transform: uppercase;">SPOTLIGHT TALK: A Day in the Life of a Base Image: The Evolution of Vulnerabilities in the Most Popular Containers</h4>
                        <div><small>Containers have become the nearly de facto way for developers to package and ship software today. On Docker Hub, which saw hundreds of billions container pulls in 2021 alone, there are 130 containers that constitute more than 25% of the annual pulls - seeing 31B+ pulls annually. These include the most popular DevOps and build tools, programming languages and databases, among others.

                            While container scanning and security is becoming more widely adopted, it’s still not well-understood how these containers evolve over time from a security perspective. This includes understanding the long-term security posture of these containers, whether it is improving or declining as new vulnerabilities are discovered, as new versions are released and deployed to production.
                            
                            This talk will take a first-time look at why handling vulnerabilities in containers is a really sticky problem to begin with, with known vulnerabilities requiring patching, as new vulnerabilities arise constantly, and many other vulnerabilities simply falling into a catchall bucket of "won't fix" . We'll show data visualizations of how the attack surface of two mega-popular public DevOps and build container images have changed over the past year, highlighting the problem developers and DevSecOps teams are facing.
                            
                            We'll demonstrate how some of the most popular vulnerability scanners show different results, sometimes to extreme degrees. But stick around to the very end, because on the upside, we'll wrap up with practical steps developers can take to stay on top of vulnerabilities and prevent their dev process from grinding to a halt.</small></div>

                                   He has talked about and demonstrated ZAP at conferences all over the world, including Blackhat, JavaOne, FOSDEM and OWASP AppSec EU, USA & AsiaPac.
                                   Prior to making the move into security he was a developer for 25 years and strongly believes that you cannot build secure web applications without knowing how to attack them.</span></p>

                                    data solution for your system</h4>

                                <p>When it comes to data solutions, one-size
                                    doesn’t fit all. Choosing the right
                                    best-matching database, or data tools, can
                                    be a game changer for your system. How
                                    can
                                    you take such decision effectively? The
                                    system, the company, the product, and
                                    probably
                                    your team - all are evolving, and the best
                                    solution for today may not fit tomorrow’s
                                    needs. In order to pick a data solution for
                                    longer term, you should evaluate the
                                    optional data tools according to several
                                    factors. These factors will reflect the
                                    requirements looking forward.</p>

                                <p>At this session, we will share such use case,
                                    of evaluating data solution, when we
                                    redesigned one of Oribi features from
                                    scratch. Our goal was to avoid a data
                                    explosion
                                    crisis, while the system kept scaling up.
                                    Having so many solutions out there - we
                                    needed
                                    to make sure that we are choosing the one
                                    that will support the increasing load
                                    farthest.</p>

                                <p>Eventually we picked up ten criteria factors,
                                    which we used to compare and choose the
                                    best solution effectively. Join the session
                                    to hear what were these factors, and get
                                    prepared for choosing the next data solution
                                    for your system.</p>

                                    TALK: PRINCIPLES OF OBSERVABILITY</h4>

                                <p>The word observable entered the English
                                    language roughly 400 years ago, but the
                                    concepts
                                    of what it means to see, comprehend, and
                                    understand something have been debated
                                    since
                                    time immemorial. Starting in the 19th
                                    century, a series of postulates and criteria
                                    coalesced into control theory, and it is
                                    from this body of knowledge that we gained
                                    the
                                    word “observability”. Today, with the advent
                                    of complex, interconnected computer
                                    systems, that word has taken on new meanings
                                    and connotations—some useful, some
                                    detrimental, and some just plain confusing.</p>
                                <p>In this talk, we’ll mix a little history, a
                                    touch of philosophy, and a healthy dose
                                    of
                                    reality, to demystify what observability
                                    means to us as professional computer

                                    and unearth foundational principles that
                                    will
                                    help us to build better infrastructure,
                                    write better software, and promote healthier
                                    business practices. Finally, we’ll explore
                                    some potential new avenues for discussion
                                    and
                                    understanding.</p>
