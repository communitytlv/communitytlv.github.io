                                <p>The bottom up approach that changed the way we think about the development processes, has the
                                    potential to encompass and ultimately transform many more aspects of engineering - from development
                                    to operations and many of its subsets, such as observability, delivery and security. This
                                    transformation will dictate the future of shipping products fast and reliably.</p>

                                <p>As a founder of Elasticsearch and the CEO of <a href="https://elastic.co"
                                    target="_blank">Elastic</a>, Shay has been fascinated with search ever since trying to build a
                                recipe app for his wife in 2004, a journey that led to him writing the first few lines of code of
                                Elasticsearch in 2009 and later founding Elastic in 2012. He believes in finding beauty, and that
                                excelling takes a combination of perspective and grit. As someone who got into computers by counting
                                the number of job postings in the newspaper, he loves building things — a product, a community, or a
                                company — and the process of acquiring the knowledge to do so.</p>

                                    after having worked with the team as a founder at Dark. Her role allows her to
                                    do exactly what she
                                    loves – some investing and hands-on support for founders building pre-product,

                                    for non-Microsoft phone platforms. The common thread is building tools that help
                                    people to do
                                    creative work.</p>

                                    from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. She grew up in Rochester Hills,

                                security becomes too burdensome, users take shortcuts, find workarounds, and end up
                                jeopardizing security. Blaming users is lazy and easy. Making security usable is time
                                consuming and challenging. How does design research help us understand our customers?
                                What patterns and principles drive secure behavior? How can we build empathy with
                                customers and make the right thing to do the easiest thing to do? This session explores
                                these questions, and provides examples of how design thinking and research can help us
                                be more secure. We will walk through our creation of core user personas, design
                                principles, and how these inform and direct our design choices and intent. Don’t blame

                                    doesn't fit all - Effectively (re)evaluate a data solution for your system</h4>

                                <p>When it comes to data solutions, one-size doesn’t fit all. Choosing the right
                                    best-matching database, or data tools, can be a game changer for your system. How
                                    can
                                    you take such decision effectively? The system, the company, the product, and
                                    probably
                                    your team - all are evolving, and the best solution for today may not fit tomorrow’s
                                    needs. In order to pick a data solution for longer term, you should evaluate the
                                    optional data tools according to several factors. These factors will reflect the
                                    requirements looking forward.</p>

                                <p>At this session, we will share such use case, of evaluating data solution, when we
                                    redesigned one of Oribi features from scratch. Our goal was to avoid a data
                                    explosion
                                    crisis, while the system kept scaling up. Having so many solutions out there - we
                                    needed
                                    to make sure that we are choosing the one that will support the increasing load
                                    farthest.</p>

                                <p>Eventually we picked up ten criteria factors, which we used to compare and choose the
                                    best solution effectively. Join the session to hear what were these factors, and get
                                    prepared for choosing the next data solution for your system.</p>

                                <p>The word observable entered the English language roughly 400 years ago, but the
                                    concepts
                                    of what it means to see, comprehend, and understand something have been debated
                                    since
                                    time immemorial. Starting in the 19th century, a series of postulates and criteria
                                    coalesced into control theory, and it is from this body of knowledge that we gained
                                    the
                                    word “observability”. Today, with the advent of complex, interconnected computer
                                    systems, that word has taken on new meanings and connotations—some useful, some
                                    detrimental, and some just plain confusing.</p>

                                <p>In this talk, we’ll mix a little history, a touch of philosophy, and a healthy dose
                                    of
                                    reality, to demystify what observability means to us as professional computer
                                    people.
                                    We’ll tear through the marketing material and unearth foundational principles that
                                    will
                                    help us to build better infrastructure, write better software, and promote healthier
                                    business practices. Finally, we’ll explore some potential new avenues for discussion
                                    and
                                    understanding.</p>
