            <h4>ABSTRACT:</h4>
            <p>Fifteen years ago, we'd barely started to use S3, and ten years ago DevOps was the new thing. Today, we
                can add a new tool, technology, or trick every week, and more and more work is shifted into the
                application developer's workflow. If security, resiliency, and incident response become part of product
                teams, where will we be ten years from now, and what should we do today to get ready?
            </p>
            <strong>BIO:</strong>
            <small>
                <p>Ellen is Founder in Residence at boldstart Ventures. She joined the boldstart team in January 2021,
                    after having worked with the team as a founder at Dark. Her role allows her to do exactly what she
                    loves – some investing and hands-on support for founders building pre-product, dev-focused,
                    enterprise companies.</p>

                <p>Prior to boldstart and founding Dark, she worked at Blade as an EIR, seeding the work for what became
                    Lola. She also worked on backer-facing projects at Kickstarter and on the first versions of Office
                    for non-Microsoft phone platforms. The common thread is building tools that help people to do
                    creative work.</p>

                <p>Ellen has an a M.B.A from Harvard Business School, and a B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering
                    from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. She grew up in Rochester Hills, MI, but now lives in
                    Somerville, MA with her husband and her cat, Gutenberg.</p>

                                <p>Many senior technical leaders are struggling with how to make sure that their
                                    infrastructure, code and architecture can support the business needs. The challenge
                                    is not WHAT should be done, but how to promote these tasks, how to create a unified
                                    backlog that everyone agrees on, and how to keep the right communication level with
                                    the company’s CEO, VP Product and other non-technical managers. These aspects of the
                                    system, includes security, scaling, supportability, debuggability, it's up time and
                                    more.</p>
                                <p> As a senior engineering manager, your role is to manage and prioritize these
                                    required changes as a backlog that must be tightly aligned with the company’s
                                    business needs. </p>

                                <p> In this workshop, we will understand how to manage all the technical items that can
                                    enable your business growth, what the preferred method to create the right balance
                                    for your own company is, and how to make everyone in your organization follow the
                                    same decision-making process. By gaining these techniques, you will be able to not
                                    only provide a clear technical roadmap to your system, but also communicate it well
                                    to the business people, to keep everyone on the same page for your team’s plans for
                                    next year.</p>

                            <p>CI/CD pipelines are quickly becoming the path of least resistance for would-be attackers
                                into sensitive internal systems, gaining access to critical data, with minimal effort.
                            </p>

                            <p>In the InfoSec world when we talk about CI/CD security often times this focuses on
                                specific aspects of securing your pipeline - scanning the code, protecting secrets,
                                securely managing code deployments, or even authentication and authorization mechanisms,
                                but we rarely talk about all of these together.</p>

                            <p>After years of being in the trenches and realizing that the attack surface is growing and
                                the threat landscape becoming more and more complex, it has become increasingly apparent
                                that security teams need to adapt and modify strategies to keep up with the new reality
                                of CI/CD protection, without compromising developer velocity.</p>

                            <p>In this talk I would like to propose a new way of thinking about CI/CD security - that
                                encompasses the three disciplines that comprise CI/CD security - security in the
                                pipeline, of the pipeline, and around the pipeline. Partial coverage of any or all of
                                these disciplines simply will not cut it with the continuously evolving risk landscape.
                                Security engineers need to address each of these aspects in their entirety to provide
                                the full scope of coverage that modern organizations need, and I will take a deep dive
                                on the challenges each introduce, and the approaches and techniques for mitigating them
                                based on adversarial sec research.</p>

                            <p>In your ever-changing Infrastructure, some changes are intentional while others are not.
                            </p>
                            <p>Drift is what happens whenever the real-world state of your infrastructure differs from
                                the state defined in your configuration. This can happen for many reasons, sometimes it
                                happens when adding or removing resources, other times when changing resource
                                definitions upon resource termination or failure, and even when changes have been made
                                manually or via other automation tools.
                            </p>
                            <p>While Terraform itself can detect drifts, in most cases, you will be informed about it
                                too late: just before you are about to deploy new changes to your infrastructure. What’s
                                interesting about Terraform though, is that you can apply changes in two separate and
                                distinct steps of “Planning” and “Applying”. This means that you have full visibility of
                                what Terraform is planning on doing beforehand, and if you are satisfied with the
                                changes, you can choose to apply them.
                            </p>
                            <p>So how does this work? When something is changed intentionally, it will appear in the
                                source code, and the Terraform plan will not do anything. However, if any part of the
                                infrastructure has been changed manually, Terraform’s plan will identify this, and alert
                                you to the change. In other words, if your IaC drifted from its expected state, then
                                Terraform’s plan will, in fact, detect it.
                            </p>
                            <p>Applying this simple solution can empower DevOps and developer velocity, with the
                                reassurance and context for unexpected changes in your IaC, in near real-time. This talk
                                will showcase real-world examples, and practical ways to apply this in your production
                                environments while doing so safely and at the pace of your engineering cycles.

                            <p>In every development process there is the question, do we invest enough on quality? Do we
                                need to invest more? Every team knows about the dilemma of how many tests is the right
                                amount of tests we should write. Is 80% test coverage is good enough? Maybe 90%? 100%?
                                Should we invest more time in unit testing? Are we wasting too much time on
                                unit-testing? Should we invest time on a faster rollback mechanism?</p>

                            <p>In this talk, I will share do's and don'ts on how to onboard successfully in a remote
                                or hybrid setup including moving to a leadership role, speaking from my own journey 
                                onboarding remotely in the midst of a global pandemic.
                            </p>

                            <p> I will share the tips that worked for me for succesful onboarding, how I was able to be productive,
                                impactful, and make a good impression on others.
                                The key issues as an “onbordee” that I will talk about are how to create relationships,
                                make yourself visible in the company, time management, and more.</p>
                            <p>Since I started working in Augury over 100 new employees have joined the company.
                                Each month I give a session that is part of their general onboarding process.
                                This became a crucial step due to the fact that we are now a hybrid company
                                and a lot of people are onboarding remotely or in a hybrid setup for the first time in
                                their lives. </p>
                            <p>I joined the company as a backend developer and a few months into my role,
                                the squad leader position in my squad was up for grabs and I was fortunate enough to
                                grab it :)
                                This is my first official leadership role, which I also needed to onboard into in a
                                hybrid setup.
                                I will share the process that I built for myself on “How to lead”.
                                Also, a word or two on the process we built as a squad on how we work in a hybrid setup,
                                what are we optimizing for when we do meet and how to include new members of the team.

                            <p>This is a story about taking the cloud infrastructure of a successful company, that is
                                still managed as infrastructure of a startup company, and rebuilding it to support the
                                growing business requirements, especially around disaster recovery and business
                                continuity. In the session I will share Next Insurance’s journey - where we started,
                                where we are now and what we learned on the way so far. I will talk about how we managed
                                to build our proven DR plans, and actually execute them in our DR drills. I will also
                                talk about why we decided that the only way to prove your DR plan works is to continue
                                running your business in the DR account and make it your production account, and go on
                                to build your next DR account. If you are a part of a company that is about to embark on
                                a similar journey, this session might equip you with some very useful insights on how to
                                think about such a challenge, and some very useful and practical tips on how to execute

                            <p>Configuration Management is at the core of Ops. It’s the biggest enabler of any compute
                                operation, small and big. In the past decade, we have switched from thinking about the
                                machines we are configuring, to think about the software and services we are
                                controlling. With that change of mindset, so did the tools we are using. Traditional
                                tools like Puppet, chef, salt and Ansible are slowly declining while new tools such as
                                Terraform, Pulumi, Helm and Kustomize are on the rise. In this talk I will try to
                                describe the pain-points and the opportunities of this transformation as well as
                                suggesting a future direction based on tools developed at the big-tech companies (Mainly
                                facebook and google)</p>

                        <p>In the past few years, I’ve been on a quest to build a better configuration management tool,
                            trying to learn how different companies implementing their configuration strategies. I am
                            evaluating how configuration is being described, composed, delivered and consumed while
                            developing <a href="https://protoconf.github.io/protoconf" target="_blank">protoconf</a>.
                            I’ve started protoconf because I missed the configuration tool I used while at facebook (<a

                            big-tech companies approach configuration.

                            <p>So you built your Next.js or other Node.js apps and containerized them, great job! But
                                what does it take to secure a container? Are you sure you’re following all the best
                                practices to build container images correctly? What are the threats you are not
                                mitigating in a running container? There’s no better way to understand container
                                security than seeing some live hacking! Join me to learn and adopt best practices of
                                running secure containerized applications in production.

                            <p>From idea to execution, the challenges of publishing an open source project are very
                                similar to initializing a startup when it comes to creating a successful product that
                                people will love and use.</p>

                            <p> Most open source projects are not “taking-off”, although they are really good! This is
                                because developers (which are usually the creators of open source projects) think that
                                writing the code is the hard part and “neglect” the other parts of publishing a good
                                open source project.</p>

                            <p>In this talk, I will use my experience as a contributor to open source and product head
                                of a startup, to go beyond writing the code itself and cover the other central aspects
                                of creating an open source project, like MVP, product/market fit, marketing and more.

                                be forgotten in a few years. You might think: “Why do I need to learn a new way to write APIs when
                                REST already answers all my needs?”. Or, you are excited to learn something new but don’t believe

                                REST. I will then explain what GraphQL is and demonstrate how it solves these pain points. Next, I
                                will discuss the disadvantages of GraphQL. Finally, I will provide some guidelines for choosing
                                between REST and GraphQL. By the end of this talk, you will understand what GraphQL is and when to
                                use it.</p>

                            <p>“The International Space Station has been orbiting the Earth for over 20 years. It was
                                not launched fully formed, as a monolith in space. Instead, it is built out of dozens of
                                individual modules, each with a dedicated role - life support, engineering, science,
                                commercial applications and more. Each module (or container) functions as a
                                microservice, adding additional capabilities to the whole. Not only do the modules need
                                to function together, delivering both functional and non-functional capabilities, they
                                were designed, developed and built by different countries on Earth and once launched
                                into space (deployed in multiple different ways), had to work together - perfectly.</p>

                            <p>Despite the many (minor) reliability issues which have occurred over the decades, the ISS
                                remains a highly reliable platform for cutting edge scientific and engineering research.
                            </p>

                            <p>In this session I will describe the way the space station was developed and the lessons
                                Site Reliability and DevOps Engineers can learn from it.</p>

                        <p>In this bleak, depressing talk we will discuss some of the ways computer science and computer
                            security has fallen flat on its face, and how you can avoid making the same mistakes, with
                            just a soupçon of humor for good measure.</p>

                        <p>We will break these problems down and hopefully learn some important lessons, such as not
                            allowing your door locks to call system(), how to properly secure your corner of the
                            Internet Of Things, a crash course in processor architectures and how they lie to you, and
                            how the inevitable heat-death of the universe is a result of RSA.</p>

                        <p>Hopefully, you’ll emerge feeling smarter, discussing new topics, and slightly terrified.</p>

                        <p>The last two decades have been all about SaaS, with advantages that cannot be
                            overstated. Except SaaS isn’t always an option, nor is it always the right choice:
                            businesses in tightly regulated industries, or where information security is paramount,
                            for example, will not - often can not - consider any software that isn’t under their
                            control. For many software enterprises, this leads to the dreaded inevitability of
                            on-premise deployment.</p>

                        <p>Fortunately, the situation today is dramatically different to a scant few years ago, let
                            alone a decade or two: the same technologies that enable SaaS have also radically
                            transformed on-prem deployment. Modern tools like Docker, Consul, ELK and Kubernetes -
                            to name a few - can be leveraged to completely transform the experience for both
                            customers and vendors. In this talk we’ll contrast the challenges and advantages of SaaS
                            and on-prem, see how things have evolved in recent history, and see how modern on-prem
                            deployment can be, if not pleasurable, at least relatively painless.</p>

                        <p>One of the hardest challenges data teams face today is selecting which tools to use in
                            their workflow. Marketing messages are vague, and you continuously hear of new buzzwords
                            you “just have to have in your stack”. There is a constant stream of new tools,
                            open-source and proprietary that make buyer’s remorse especially bad. I call it “MLOps
                            Fatigue”.</p>

                        <p>This talk will not discuss a specific MLOps tool, but instead present guidelines and
                            mental models for how to think about the problems you and your team are facing, and how
                            to select the best tools for the task. We will review a few example problems, analyze
                            them, and suggest Open Source solutions for them. We will provide a mental framework
                            that will help tackle future problems you might face and extract the concrete value each
                            tool provides.</p>

                        <h5>What you’ll learn</h5>
                        <p>You’ll learn what signals to watch for to notice you might have MLOps fatigue. How to
                            define the challenge you’re facing and which questions to ask in order to build a
                            “decision tree” for selecting the best-suited tools for the task. A few examples for
                            using this framework in practice on challenges involving data management and automating
                            training/pipeline tasks</p>

                        <p>About 2 years ago we faced a crisis in our DevOps consulting company - the market demand
                            was
                            higher than we could supply. The traditional recruiting process depending on CV and
                            artificial credentials was not working. So we came up with an alternative solution, and
                            since then - we are growing exponentially and diversely. In this talk we will show the
                            practical tools we deployed in order to increase our capacity, and we will show how
                            these
                            tools overcome the inherited bias in the process.</p>

                <p>This is for you, you rockstar, ninja coffee drinking workaholic who doesn’t know what a vacation day
                    looks like. Even though you love your job and are dedicated and are super important, you need a
                    break too.<br />
                    We tend to think that working all the time is an effective practice while the truth is that finding
                    the time for self care and recharging your batteries is beneficial for both you and your company.
                    Additionally, if you’re a leader, you’re responsible for the wellbeing of your team. In this talk
                    I’ll discuss the importance of taking time off of work and creating a positive culture surrounding
                    vacation time.<br />

                        is a wheel. tech is a spiral</span></summary>
                <p>Presenting the concept of spiral history in computer technology, with very little examples. spiral
                    history is a metaphor for how we do the same stuff every few years but they work out a little bit
                    different.<br />
                    “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” or so it is said, in technology and
                    even more specifically in computer science it still holds true, however in computer science it is
                    not exactly repeating and sometimes in our very young field forgetting the past actually helps since
                    what haven’t worked before might work today. 5 minutes for 2 examples of spiral history and i hope
                    you will accept this theory.

                    was planned, well… man plans and COVID coughs in their face. <br />
