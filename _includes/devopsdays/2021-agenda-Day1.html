                <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                <p>The bottom up approach that changed the way we think about the development processes, has the
                    potential to encompass and ultimately transform many more aspects of engineering - from development
                    to operations and many of its subsets, such as observability, delivery and security. This
                    transformation will dictate the future of shipping products fast and reliably.</p>

                <p>Open source software alongside self-service cloud infrastructure, have enabled engineers to openly
                    collaborate around software; this was the key to making the DevOps culture and the bottom up
                    transformation possible. </p>
                <p>Shay Banon, Founder and CEO of Elastic, will share from his personal experience and vision what he
                    thinks the future of engineering will look like when we bring these disparate disciplines together.
                </p>
                <h4>Bio:</h4>

                <p>As a founder of Elasticsearch and the CEO of <a href="https://elastic.co"
                        target="_blank">Elastic</a>, Shay has been fascinated with search ever since trying to build a
                    recipe app for his wife in 2004, a journey that led to him writing the first few lines of code of
                    Elasticsearch in 2009 and later founding Elastic in 2012. He believes in finding beauty, and that
                    excelling takes a combination of perspective and grit. As someone who got into computers by counting
                    the number of job postings in the newspaper, he loves building things — a product, a community, or a
                    company — and the process of acquiring the knowledge to do so.</p>

                            principle of how to manage these changes in a live system are all the same. We will use
                            examples from our previous projects to demonstrate these principles, and hopefully, our

                            <p>So, the firefighters are in your data center, this is not a drill. There is no
                                electricity, and the pager is more like a DDoS attack on your phone. You look at your
                                watch, multiple thoughts running through your head. Why me? Why now? How do you pull the
                                team out and through this catastrophe?</p>
                            <p>In this session we will look at managing a crisis of significant magnitude, where all the
                                organization is impacted and there is no clear path through to resolution. We will
                                review the following: - The culture of a learning organization going into the crisis. -
                                Crisis management “in action” - Running a blameless post mortem - Creating tools for
                                high engagement to support the crisis manager. During the presentation we will share
                                real life events, such as a data center going dark with real firefighters coming to the
                                rescue, and production services in the cloud that stop responding.</p>

                                    Ariel joined Taboola as Vice President of Information Technology in February 2014.
                                    With over 20 years of experience in Information Security and IT systems, Ariel leads

                                        - BARAK:</strong>“Trying is the first step towards failure”, said the great
                                    Homer Simpson and I would add that “Failing is the first step towards
                                    success”.<br />
                                    I’ve been around software since 2006, in various companies and positions, from C4
                                    system for intercepting rockets through E-commerce and Ad-Tech.<br />
                                    I'm always keen to learn new technologies and test them to see how far to the edge I
                                    can take them. I practice this passion by day at Taboola with our team of rockstars,
                                    while by night I spend time on my second passion - brewing my own beer.</span></p>

                            <p>Github Copilot and tools that help us code better are cool. But I’m lucky if I spend 90
                                minutes a day writing code. We really need to optimize the hours we spend reviewing
                                code, updating tickets and tracing where our code is deployed. Learn how I save an hour
                                a day streamlining non-coding tasks.</p>
                            <p>This talk is unique because 99% of developer productivity tools and hacks are about
                                coding faster, better, smarter. And yet the vast majority of our time is spent doing all
                                of this other stuff. After I started focusing on optimizing the 10 hours I spend every
                                day on non-coding tasks, I found I my productivity went up and my frustration at
                                annoying stuff went way down.

                                I cover how to save time by reducing cognitive load and by cutting menial, non-coding
                                tasks that we have to perform 10-50 times every day. For example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bug or hotfix comes through and you want to start working on it right away so you
                                    create a branch and start fixing. What you don’t do is create a Jira ticket but then
                                    later your boss/PM/CSM yells at your due to lack of visibility. I share how I
                                    automated ticket creation in Slack by correlating Github to Jira.</li>

                                <li>You have 20 minutes until your next meeting and you open a pull request and start a
                                    review. But you get pulled away half way through and when you come back the next day
                                    you forgot everything and have to start over. Huge waste of time. I share an ML job
                                    I wrote that tells me how long the review will take so I can pick PRs that fit the
                                    amount of time I have.</li>

                                <li>You build. You ship it. You own it. Great. But after I merge my code I never know
                                    where it actually is. Did the CI job fail? Is it release under feature flag? Did it
                                    just go GA to everyone? I share a bot I wrote that personally tells me where my code
                                    is in the pipeline after it leaves my hands so I can actually take full ownership
                                    without spending tons of time figuring out what code is in what release.</li>

                                    Hello! I’m Ori Keren, CEO and Co-founder at LinearB. I got my first coding job in
                                    1999 and eventually became VP of Engineering for multiple start-ups before starting
                                    my own company. Before all that, my first experience programming was in Basic. In
                                    1987 I was in 5th grade. My parents bought me a Sinclair Spectrum ZX with 48k RAM. I
                                    vividly remember the day I got that machine. A fire lit inside me and it never went
                                    away :-) That’s why I do this job.</span></p>

                            <p>When it comes to data solutions, one-size doesn’t fit all. Choosing the right
                                best-matching database, or data tools, can be a game changer for your system. How can
                                you take such decision effectively? The system, the company, the product, and probably
                                your team - all are evolving, and the best solution for today may not fit tomorrow’s
                                needs. In order to pick a data solution for longer term, you should evaluate the
                                optional data tools according to several factors. These factors will reflect the
                                requirements looking forward.</p>

                            <p>At this session, we will share such use case, of evaluating data solution, when we
                                redesigned one of Oribi features from scratch. Our goal was to avoid a data explosion
                                crisis, while the system kept scaling up. Having so many solutions out there - we needed
                                to make sure that we are choosing the one that will support the increasing load
                                farthest.</p>

                            <p>Eventually we picked up ten criteria factors, which we used to compare and choose the
                                best solution effectively. Join the session to hear what were these factors, and get
                                prepared for choosing the next data solution for your system.</p>

                            <p>The word observable entered the English language roughly 400 years ago, but the concepts
                                of what it means to see, comprehend, and understand something have been debated since
                                time immemorial. Starting in the 19th century, a series of postulates and criteria
                                coalesced into control theory, and it is from this body of knowledge that we gained the
                                word “observability”. Today, with the advent of complex, interconnected computer
                                systems, that word has taken on new meanings and connotations—some useful, some
                                detrimental, and some just plain confusing.</p>

                            <p>In this talk, we’ll mix a little history, a touch of philosophy, and a healthy dose of
                                reality, to demystify what observability means to us as professional computer people.
                                We’ll tear through the marketing material and unearth foundational principles that will
                                help us to build better infrastructure, write better software, and promote healthier
                                business practices. Finally, we’ll explore some potential new avenues for discussion and
                                understanding.</p>

                            <p>If operations is a classic big data problem, cloud Operations is a *huge* data problem.
                                We all understand the volume of logs, alerts and metrics generated by SaaS applications,
                                and the increasing complexity of hybrid infrastructure, requires you to step up your
                                monitoring strategy and just like any other big data problem – it only makes sense to
                                leverage AI to achieve the observability imperative.</p>

                            <p>Taking into consideration the sheer volume of IT monitoring data that you have to deal
                                with each and every day as DevOps, IT or SRE- leveraging traditional, reactive
                                monitoring tools and approaches wont cut it much longer. Infusing AI is not about
                                magically identifying and automatically solving all your problems, but given the
                                criticality of delivering a phenomenal user experience for SaaS- you can leverage
                                machine learning models to provide you with insights-rather than data- to not only
                                effectively detect abnormal behaviors but also to predict potential issues, map them to
                                associated services and help you intelligently prioritize preventive, troubleshooting
                                and remediation efforts.</p>

                            <p>Building and operating a global cloud infrastructure at a large scale is a complex task
                                with hundreds of ever-evolving service components. I am happy to share with you some
                                real-world examples of how AI is leveraged at Azure Marketplace and Linkedin scale to
                                monitor wisely, predict capacity and save costs so you can think how you can take it
                                home, and apply it in your production environments.

                            <p>“Being oncall sucks. But it doesn’t have to!” We all heard this one before. Why is it
                                though, that oncall still remains the biggest scar for many? What can a modern
                                Engineering org do to rein the oncall dragons, and actually help people grow as
                                professionals as they go oncall?</p>

                            <p>In this talk, I will present the main reasons why oncall is difficult in modern orgs, and
                                describe ways to mitigate these hardships. The idea is that oncall is often the
                                ‘backroom’ of an org, where all the technical and organizational debt take their toll.
                                Be it unwieldy systems or broken processes between teams, oncall checks all the ‘weak
                                boxes’. Therefore, the only way to win at oncall is to sort out your debts, starting
                                with the organizational ones.</p>

                            <p>I will dive into the detail of the oncall rotation at Snyk as the org scaled from 1 to
                                220 people, what worked well about it, and what was less than perfect. I will discuss
                                the decisions made to turn oncall into a building block of the org, and show a path to
                                rein oncall in your organization as well.</p>

                            <p>In this talk I will present OpenTelemetry, an ambitious open source project with the
                                promise of a unified framework for collecting observability data. With OpenTelemetry you
                                could instrument your application in a vendor-agnostic way, and then analyze the
                                telemetry data in your backend tool of choice, whether Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, or
                                others.</p>

                            <p>I will cover the current state of the various projects of OpenTelemetry (across

                            <p>With the increasing complexity of modern applications, continuous profiling methods and
                                tools are gaining popularity among the Developer and Engineering communities. In this
                                session, we cover what continuous profiling entails and why you should implement a
                                profiler into your tech stack (if you haven’t done so already). We’ll then bring theory
                                to practice and demonstrate a real-life scenario using gProfiler, a free open-source
                                continuous profiling tool, covering Linux servers on multiple architectures (such as
                                Graviton).</p>

                                the default views and how different kinds of vision impairments affect those. The talks

        <p>If your enterprise is part of the growing trend, you already have or are planning for a multicloud
            environment. Not surprisingly, management of identities and permissions is different from one public cloud
            to the next, adding more complexity to the fray. In any case, managing cloud identities well needs to be a
            priority: Gartner predicts that, by 2023, 75% of cloud security failures will be attributable to inadequate
            management of identities, access and privileges.</p>
        <p>We’ve put some time into understanding how AWS and Azure handle access management, and where they align and
            differ, and would like to share that knowledge with you. Join this one-hour workshop to learn essential
            basics for how to manage access risk in AWS and Azure. We will cover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Structuring cloud resources correctly</li>
            <li>Assigning least privilege policies and controlling identities</li>
            <li>Protecting sensitive resources with policy controls</li>
            <li>Using cloud provider access governance tools</li>
            <li>Achieving least privilege with automated analysis</li>
        </ul>

                        <p>Security people say users are the weakest link. But are they? When complying with security
                            becomes too burdensome, users take shortcuts, find workarounds, and end up jeopardizing
                            security. Blaming users is lazy and easy. Making security usable is time consuming and
                            challenging. How does design research help us understand our customers? What patterns and
                            principles drive secure behavior? How can we build empathy with customers and make the right
                            thing to do the easiest thing to do? This session explores these questions, and provides
                            examples of how design thinking and research can help us be more secure. We will walk
                            through our creation of core user personas, design principles, and how these inform and
                            direct our design choices and intent. Don’t blame your users anymore. Come learn how to be
                            part of a future where usability leads security.</p>

                        <p>Have you ever felt you took every wrong turn possible in the process of mitigating a
                            production incident? Did you go through a 3-hour hell during incident response and felt the
                            incident wasn’t complex enough to justify the horrors you’ve experienced? Did it cause you
                            to question your engineering or problem-solving skills?</p>

                        <p>Well, it’s only partially you. Our brain is wired to make decision-making simpler. In doing
                            so, it exposes itself to biases, heuristics, and other quirks that may seem like “bad
                            decisions” in hindsight.</p>

                        <p>In this talk, through real-life outages, we’ll project those psychological principles onto
                            the world of production monitor, and incident management. As a responder, you’ll learn why
                            those behavioral patterns emerge during production incidents and what can be done to limit
                            their effect, and as a manager, you’ll learn how to enable and encourage a healthy
                            environment to better support those patterns.</p>

                            gender and ethnicity bias? Nearly impossible. At this talk we will show our tools and
                            methods implemented in the Develeap hiring process that overcome this inherited bias.</p>

                        <p>About 2 years ago we faced a crisis in our DevOps consulting company - the market demand was
                            higher than we could supply. The traditional recruiting process depending on CV and
                            artificial credentials was not working. So we came up with an alternative solution, and
                            since then - we are growing exponentially and diversely. In this talk we will show the
                            practical tools we deployed in order to increase our capacity, and we will show how these
                            tools overcome the inherited bias in the process.</p>

                    technology. Having worked as a web, infrastructure, and
                    database engineer for more than ten years, Philipp is now working as a developer advocate at Elastic
                    — the company behind the open source Elastic Stack consisting of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and
                    Logstash. Based in Vienna, Austria, he is constantly traveling Europe and beyond to speak and

                <summary><strong style="text-transform: uppercase;">SPOTLIGHT IGNITE (10 Minutes): The future of
                        Developer Tools: From StackOverflow to Co-Pilot</strong> - Meirav Feiler, Github</summary>
                <p>When writing code there are many common repetitive tasks that we need to write but don't want to
                    invent ourselves, such as CRUD operations, http client etc. There are of course many frameworks and
                    packages that we can use and rely on but we need to learn how to use them. So in most cases for
                    implementing common operations and patterns we find ourselves searching in Google.</p>

                <p>With very basic string syntax we search for what we are looking for and usually the search engine
                    will give us back a Stack Overflow solution. In most cases we will copy and paste it (or some
                    similar version of it) to our IDE. This process is time consuming, error prone and distracting, we
                    lose our focus and context every time we leave the IDE to the browser and make decisions on our code
                    that might be risky. However, relying on the knowledge of the developer community is important and
                    very helpful for all of us.</p>

                <p>So Instead of searching on the web for solutions, it seems that integrating stack overflow inside
                    our IDE will make developers more efficient and less likely to make mistakes. With the continued
                    growth of technology, prediction tools such as Intellij and AI systems a new line of developer tools
                    emerges such as CoPilot , Kite and TabNine that are going to shape the future of developers. These
                    tools have an AI engine that is able to give code suggestions for whole lines or entire functions
                    right inside the IDE based on simple sentences.</p>

                <p>This might sound scary for many of us developers, as it's going to change the way we work but I
                    actually think it's exciting. In my talk I am going to share with you a bit more details about these
                    tools and how they work and why I think all of us should take part in shaping our future.

                        the Engineering Director of npm which is owned by GitHub. In the past year me and my teams have
                        been working hard on improving npm’s CI/CD process moving from old tools and manual scripts to a
                        fully automated CI/CD flow using GitHub. In this process we have learned a lot and I will try in
                        my talk to share those learning and give our best practices.
