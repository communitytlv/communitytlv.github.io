	<div><p>In this talk, we’ll analyze real-world software update fails & how multiple DevOps patterns, that fit a variety of scenarios, could have saved the developers. Manually making sure that everything works before sending an update and expecting the user to do the acceptance tests before they update is most definitely not on the list of such patterns.</p>

	<div><p>With a fast paced CI/CD process and a high rate of deployments happening in a micro services base infrastructure, bugs can slip through the tests into production & when that happens you want to protect yourself & your customers from being exposed to this situation. Adding another layer of protection using a canary release/rollout process in your K8s cluster can give you this level of protection if done right, there is no one ring to rule them all, but guidelines that enable you to achieve the best canary rollout process you can have using Argo Rollouts</p>

	<div><p>With the acceleration of scale and complexity in distributed architectures, the pressure to understand when and where there was abnormal behavior, identify why it occurred, quickly fix it, & prevent similar issues from happening in the future is rapidly growing.<br/>

        Here is where observability comes into play. Observability gives you an inside look at what’s happening in your distributed system, empowering you to understand what is slow or broken & what you can do to improve performance, from pre-production to deployment.<br/>
        
        In this talk, we will explore the future of observability and the upcoming observability trends. We’ll introduce you to the three pillars of observability (metrics, traces, and logs) & show you how you can use them to make your system more observable.<br/>
        
        And finally, we’ll explain how you can make observability actionable & scalable for your team by using OpenTelemetry (an open-source project and a member of the CNCF).</p>
